No.  Are they fit like not the Tobacco on these are just asking but I put one up and just like it was like my entire mouth was just like pulsating. I just couldn't is kind of like the icon, like I like how it felt to.  Continent that wants to try it.  I've tried so you know that it just it just feels really weird.  Either.  Like I care if you want to just like that, and then just closing up. Soon as blacks.  Separate hair will like up that some people like putting it like in the back of my gums like that.  Really?  Does Emily have any connection?  Eventually.  have it in for a little bit, and then we'll see, like  When if I retry it?  I'll give it a tablet on this and I did it once in Sweden like a very sweet. This news is a tobacco and you got some gum gum original one as much as I can.  Redistricting what is real? Right. That's how I feel about it, but I kept it off.  It feels weird.  The other thing this country to keep on eating and drinking.  You can send stuff to say. It's so nice. Just having coffee in the sink. I feel like I just feel like I can't as much as like, as much as anything ruin. So, you know.  Not know.  Will you be here for my birthday?  How long you here me to pretty much?  Like we never went outside anything. We should do that more, but we should do what we can.  What's like what's like Emily Latin?  I would love to meet some but like like I lost you but like what was your point of connection? Like, Howard the deal?  I don't know.  Random shit said, buys it.  A conversation, like one of my friends, like it, when we hang out with them to get together for one last time to see you kind of liked trained to me a little better. I think, when I know when I'm around you, I definitely  Lower.  The problem is that sometimes but sometimes it just right. I mean, people like talk about calling shows that you watch and you talk about shows, like I feel like it's on fast, like just biased, just one particular, full move media, and then just like, if like, see if someone's read it and then it's like no one talks about it.  I'll talk to you about.  I feel like that's what kind of wonderful. See what wonderful about TV is that you have liked it. I feel like you can in the face with a, at many different levels, you know, like, you can, you can come in but like, I can think about it. You can come in from like a very, very plain. What Ivan got out wherever you want to go. You can get them, just funny that you can get up with normal set. You can get it like me for set. Most of the time, the TV has, all of it inside of it, you know.  I think sometimes it does.  Do I also like I don't like when it's when it devolves to just reference, but I like when people try to like a ticket at things and try to look at it like that. So that feelings and stuff in different ways and then just like quoting shit that people have said, you know, like just trying to pass through Foucault again, will I could not know about food, I mean, about you, I say,  Reading fuuka.  I don't do I like fruit but it's different. It's like in your only point in conversation is just like talking about someone else's idea that's there.  Great French.  I heard about that. But before she got fired, the transformative experience.  Like for what? Just of all time, great experience.  Like, I didn't trust 3.5 G.  Visuals.  How to get?  Would you like scabs of like stuff that's not strong? Cuz I'm like not sure of what is that? She doing too bad. That's like, you know as a with weed. I feel like you have some kind of like Baseline.  Yeah.  You know, that Abbot would like justice. I didn't feel like I was like, the major pothead. I'm like, I'm always like inside during dinner was, was was very. He was talking about how like people like me and would like I feel like I'm always like extremely strong and I'm always liked very much pursuing something I like.  Yeah, he's at home. So I'm sexy girl off of the time. Like it makes me like she'll actually like I'm not slow down to us a much more of this. I can relate to people. I don't have to, like, I don't have to talk. I can just to like be the end. Something that like, it's something, it's like, I think we'd it's been a bit, like a great liked, it was a great teacher for a while, you know, in like a really going down to after the other. That's why I really liked it. Cuz it could have contracted some of that. The abrasive sides of of me, anything it told me to be much more sympathetic as well and so grateful for it, but I also like realize that like, it was unhealthy definitely a little bit.  Just kind of pointless. Are you just not really possible?  I think I I I mean I feel like for a lot of people they have, you know, you have a little bit of both and I think when I started to feel like I was getting into the 80%, that's what I'm stopping. But like I always felt like I was like a lot of people to stop doing stuff. They really really just stops you from like pursuing things.  So, you were saying, I returned for like, the first random shaped, like, making stuff doing stuff. They were actually remember and like, random should like in golf cart on this property.  I think if you like or like like, when it's making music.  Justin Bieber in Gandhi.  Wow.  Make that weird thing in the throat.  This is a crazy.  Don't make your household lose.

I like it went when I when it does come out. Next time is what I'm saying. So when I do do like a stop, then unlike something that's whatever the next thing, you know, and then it's like, if you cut a negative, you know that I'm not really in for the reinforcements and me sharing things like that.  That's why.  Why I didn't just now in the car. Nobody don't want to anymore.  Do you miss it? It's option? No, but I don't want to watch it. No, because I have a will to watch this more just like I owe. I'm doing this because Axel but I don't it's fine again. I also like, I don't know him. But the thing that is the case is that I don't actually end up watching too much TV on because that I don't think I have like necessary. Like a really developed sense of like,  TV Pace to or anything like that.  So it's like I was one show and I've done everything, I know but I know.  Okay, I'm not blaming you. I'm just, I'm just saying if that's okay.  Stop talking about it, please. Let's just not talk about it, please.  The only thing.  That's all I'm saying.  You know, I don't, I don't want to. That's okay. Then I say that that's what I want to say.  Yeah, I am. I just like in this conversation. The chance isn't going to happen right here.

I realize that's what does the fox say.  Paintings of like everything that I believed in life isn't as I thought faulty. So now we know now in my old age is meditations on first philosophy.  I think it's they caught these a dick Haas. I'm like, who's bigger?  It's only now. He's like now at the at the end of my life.

Did that to his wife and his guilt, his own will, so need to like he realize it convinced himself is the best ultimately what it is. And that's why I think that there is a healthy amount of just like a doubt and realizing that everything just kind of weird and random and then you should just enjoy it. And some point, you know, that's a got real. That's a real like thing that I think about sometimes I'm like, okay, everything is really, really like it. Like, like trees and plants like been like it in putting out any sort of like exactly that. It's crazy. And then and then and then they even like, just like the fact that we like put things in, then it comes out. It's so we ain't got like the taking one's self. Seriously.

I would like the music itself often times cuz it's like something's low production like it. It's pretty simple stuff that, you know, it's mostly about like what they saying and what that sentiment isn't. Then you like if you see what in the music people, like you will see into the little bit into that psyche.  That must be a horrible experience.  What, why did she assault a cop? When was cops? But like,  The problem is, is that this, the problem is that there has to be trust. There is well, right, since, cuz you'll get answers, like the deepest, possible and psyche.  How parents do hallucinogens?  He's trying to fight.  Yeah, it's insane. It was just someone who's just like I feel like I like the wild would be about. That will be a lot of those people and just did some hallucinogens suggested. They got some kind of some kind of like inside into oh shit. You know, I'm a, I'm a bad person. They just don't understand it themselves.  They just don't understand the implications of what that everyone just do their own thing and just after all, you know, it offends your money if you make it, you know, and you deserve that because you, you watch whatever it's like. And I'm like, I'm not like opposed to people walking in making money. That's not one. If it's not. It's just I just. Yes, exactly. Exactly. You rather have a look Beyond. Yeah, exactly.  And that's it. That's the problem is that like it's couched in so much like language in like it. So, it's just like currency stuff, you know, or if it's just like a reorganization of the Business Without You Doing is, you know, firing everyone. I'm dropping everybody and doing, you know, so it's like it's a Scout symbol this this like a language that's like hides what they doing.  No, no, absolute beautiful. Just beautiful.  The absolutely nothing. What it's like animals are just like  Constantly on drop cuz I'm not on drugs. But like that, that perception is just like a hypothetical.  Yeah.  the animals on scared of you because no reason when you're like  Event houses. So I just hope that's okay.  What's the language? Like I hate you?  And since the fact that like it, when the biggest examples of us would be the entire would be like in Globe, listen specifically. In like, it. Never like thousands and thousands of countries that's making good money, by doing manufacturing and stuff. Write in order to sort of like a pay for the extravagant lifestyles of the very few basic. It's it's it's slavery, right-wing fundamentalist. Like it's the Beast. People walking by like 30, like like sense like subsistence level like the sense and like in horrible conditions, you know, I like killing that tennis in a different country, sounds like different regulations. Indifference is not all like, we're not even think about that. These bad, these bad, you just in the globe has Amanda the basic in the. These basic systems would like to feed our own consumption. We hide the fact that we have like most of the world's population, like kind of  Ugly cough and slaved, you know, nobody ever contact.

But at the end of the day, it's like it's like it's actually like something else and we just like hitting it and what I mean by like clubs and then we talked about the currencies like about them and see. This is what you know, that currency is just like not very highly valued and that's what the problem is. We use the currency, you know, it's like that's like the difference.  Mockingbird.

Like an experiment was like based on like slightly flawed grounds, but I just feel like there are so many other like hypothesis that we need like it validates faster before you leave. Cuz I can do even though like why why I would like the reasons for it. Like it's like all they lying. It's to do without you really fast.  yeah, but  please keep off the rock wall in. Okay?

Yes, right.  Now we can sit on the bench.  When you're related to this thing, which is just insane.  You just do it. You just do it.  Exactly. I mean I mean progression in your life. Did we have a kid? It's not really about like  A jerk reflex. I was I was like my parents are very open about the fact that we will mistakes and thought they were just in case. But I we were we were both our sakes. I'm not that makes sense in like almost like it's better to be honest about it. I feel like a lot of parents mistakes and I think most people probably aren't mistakes, how many people actually like the wig and they're like, really try to do this now. Feel like if that does not seem like how probability  I was praying to like Krishna to have a service like okay, if I were to filter the population, I would I would say like IVF for Reliable way to see if a person is a mistake or not IVF.  Oh.  Exactly. Will just have a kid.  Make you like forgive them moving but like the intentional angry at them for moving. I'm just now. It's just that's that's that's them. We just we just kids. I just think that people people don't plan it and I'm wondering if I'm also wondering if we should that's a thing. Like that's all the question, right? Is that like at the same time? I'm like, oh, we should be much more conscious about everything in my life. You understand things bastard, like, listen to our emotions and be very careful with them. But the same time, it's like, okay, on the other side of the things, like, we also moving farther and farther away from just like natural, this animal living, which is like, might also be something that might be good. Just like living and not thinking about anything and just like doing it and just animals in like, not trying to understand. It's and maybe that's like a healthy way to live. I'm not sure what it might be.  Looks like understanding when we like it's a good to move away from her like animal nature and when it's good to maintain it cuz I've been I was on that grind for a while but over to stand up like all these like other things like language or just obscuring it. I like my base instincts. Like I don't like violence, That's a classic feature of being an animal in nature like that. That's just like the way you live. Like I don't like throwing moved away from that Nature's. I've also been life, worth exploring is good.  Tug of war, though. Society did try to give it up.  This one time she came and and I just like, it was really sad for me because I thought that's what it takes to survive. Just really sad to me than have the higher-level functioning to read that like hijack and just wait and ask yourself. Am I really in danger? Can I finish, can I like sit here with just a little longer?  She can't reason it didn't have the structures for it and say that we like the humans can lick train themselves. Like we can train ourselves and we do constantly, we just trained ourselves. So strange that one of my biggest things has been like $0.05, like if I'm in a conversation, I'm like, okay. This is like, they're starting to perceive me is like, awkward or like, I'm starting to feel like stupid. I'll like we've the situation I haven't liked trained myself. I don't think that it's a bad thing that has better than you get. That's an obvious one. Is that you fight back, you know, if you've always thought I was weird, when I always liked, run out in, like go off on their own, go for walks and stuff. Without that's my  And I need some, they got back in like, send to myself size. Don't stop, doing like a flex. Getting really mean and an empathetic. You know, I'm just being like a girl. I can't really deal with you right now. So I'm just going to be me and just like to ignore you, like I can, I talk like it, you know, so I know it's not. Like, I'd rather just separate myself and make myself, like, I'm okay. And then I can move out since the wild again and default. Why don't? I don't think that's like, I think in order for you to like, not hijack, sometimes you have to be like, sometimes for some people, it's like, I feel like they can get a little pessimistic. You have to be a little more like, ruthless. I got to be a little more like it.  You know, if the tissues off to be like Jaden off so that you can deal with people.

You're helping a pathetic right now cuz you weren't sure Claire not able to access but those was an does a schooling people drops off calling people would have all like telling people that doing something wrong and then like by doing that, we hope that we can link. Breaker pops, is something like structures or engineering? Wait, wait, under that, something is up with constantly. Like it decoding people who are close to me.  Re-engineered by different things.  I'm an all-black is.  Like so important that like you become structured towards one person really into and then always being like torn between different peoples like wants and needs and whatever. So you have to have some kind of like a dialogue between I know, I'm not sure if that's true.  Get more, no more saying it because you feel like I do it look like reality is not just my individual experience. Like we actually can exist and experience reality in the same way together. That's why it doesn't  On the work to do, this Collective structure in public housing monogamia, like, relationships, why people can have? I think a lot of people live in that they have their secondary base relationships, you know, with people, you know, based on physical stuff like this Basics office, and then they have like deep deep friends that I just think that you need someone to have that sort of a CO Consciousness that you can like, feel. I'm not insane. You know, I have to see if I can leave all you the same things. We see the same things and yeah and  We just go around blabbing about share is like a little bit call T. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's important for like that is something about  I'm not such a shocking realization. Sometimes you feel like I feel so much better that I'm talking to you guys because best friend for his friend. I'd like 20 and everybody there. I felt was just there to get laid. Get vocativ dancing scream at the top and one person actually came up to me and was like what you must confront me on why I wasn't drinking alcohol with your old ladies. I'm just like, you know, I don't really like one to get drunk right now.  I think you what happened. You adopted your uncle's Minds that took. This is my uncle questioned. And then Sunday was like, yeah, why don't you? You know, and then I'm like it now.  Dead, but I didn't end up drinking.  And I was like going to mix with unlike when you're a chem teacher. You picked that shift seriously, you know, I was like, I'm not going to fuck with my liver. So yeah, you shouldn't mix up my fucking and that wasn't enough for her. I was like why I took a Claritin and she's like, that's bullshit. And I got in my face about how she wished. She was like about to just like throw down with it. Yeah. Yeah. I think the reason why is because then they feel like that perceived and they have to be like they have to be like down to the afternoon, not be there not allowed to be crazy because if that cuz if there's someone who's so but it's like I've ever drunk and got really drunk with your grandparents of that. We are you don't want yet because I'm going to try my best not to act drunk.  And you have to confront the fact that like you're going to be silly like I know, but it's a discomfort with your cell phone.  Leslie. And I just decided that I'm going to because frankly she's socially dangerous to me wasn't respectful of my bad. I think a very basic human behavior that people should adopt as in a dumb butt. She was like organizing the party. Everything has to be just friends, take a picture. Now we're going to eat cake now. Pieces coming now was like very in control of the whole thing about, but I felt that that was the way it ends and I felt at the time like yeah, there's definitely an element is like I I feel like I'm maybe I'm making you know what that's like and you were taking to my face. Cuz like, I'm also vulnerable too hard for me to get through that party. Just because I felt like I was surrounded by people who are just kind of like reacting to what they were experiencing broader than like, I feel like you guys are so chill and you're just like by done a lot of work on yourselves. So that it says like that.  Yes.  Brenda's friend of a kind of extraneous deposit like otherwise, I would like a lot of really, really great people. Like we like I had a bunch of really good conversations and I think those are a lot of people that would like. Also, I like this venturing out. So, you know, anything about people who have done walking themselves, if you can, or you can, you can ultimately talk. It's like something that you can just like gas. But yeah, I know, it's automatic. Yeah. Something in their eyes. Just like tells you just  Podiatry listening to you like I felt about it all the time and then I give them like, okay what I'm walking on the you know, I'm just like okay. Okay. Tell them, you know, I know it takes 5 minutes when we expected this.  Earliest, ask you a question ever take that if you don't fill do the formula.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know, you know the compressor and processing talking about it analyzing. I'm a lot angrier and I'm like, 5 a lot angrier and more upset with people and I'm like, I can't believe they're like this a little too high and it was getting overwhelmed. Sounds like, okay. I'm going to go sit in the car. So, I went and you have to just at that point and we just starting to feel like the things that just starting to see things that stopped it. The tip of just like, riding the old way down. You know, you know, you just at that point you just like, okay. I know that like things are sort of like give me like I just need like 10 minutes, 30 minutes, you know, and then I can come back and then I'm like fresh again and then it can keep on going. Or I can feel like you want to listen something. Just keep on drinking and then when they feel that way, that means no time for another drink.  Set up, like it's the end. That's why people end up feeling like shit, you know, I know, but look same way like I felt immediately with you that like it was a big old turtle.  She is so real, you're just such a real person and not like a fake person which is like everyone else, you know.  Enough of the phone like a little bit, you know.  Yeah, that would know why.

So, you know, I'm so he was on the outskirts. And so if you just like saying nice things and do what, I could tell that like there was a lot more going on behind it, that he was doing the South walk. He just like fat the phone, because he wasn't comfortable in social situations. Like if you find those people who, like, Aunt don't necessarily like comfortable themselves yet, but they have that like that, like, little critical spots that like something inside them. You can just like I know you can like bring him out and you can just help bring them out. And then they can  Before he a little bit more, I think that the hidden. But I think that the more much more, I think I think that people are much more now you just have to  Feel like in a cage at that point in high school, you know, if you are totally comfortable and everything you do and everything you off but like us something wrong in being like what you like completely in the in the oil like a part of that in the crowd so deeply that you could just feel completely comfortable and yourself in which case like like I sent a comfort that we can chat on this late.  Everyone else is just like, doesn't see and I do.  Why?  Real.  What? Like, that's crazy. I think I think gaurav has a God complex definitely.

And I need something a little different kind of himself and I cannot talk in that environment and like separates himself.  Alcohol. Therapy relationship.

Three who have been struggling to make ends meet ever since their father left and how they're different desires. Sort of conflict with each other's and their situation. I first read it for class my sophomore year of high school. This is one of the first things I read that really like had a strong emotional response for me. And it also, I really got into writing what I read it. I think reading this play, evokes, like a feeling that makes me think more about the conflict between dreams in an aspirational sense, and reality is really good for, especially, for people my age. Just because it feels like a really  Have you answered? Yeah, a little bit.  I think this book does a really good job of speaking to people of a bunch of different age groups, and like each of the characters kind of, is at a different stage of their life. So I really recommend it to I think nostalgic could zap clips. ",187,11/08/21,211108_001_me.wav
0,"By the chair has find Colonel, fernholz a professor in Robert Day School. At 6, currently teaching econ, 50, which is a fun class and the book. I am discussing. The book. I picked, is the precipice by Toby. So the book is about existential risk to human. And so that means some type of event either, you know, naturally occurring made that, you know, significantly damage is human potential and flourishing like permanently. So it doesn't have to be. Everybody is wiped out but like something calamitous happened and what the author does is, he looks at at this, you know, he'd be discussing the philosophical implications of this type of existential risk, and he discusses quantitatively like what this Rich looks like for the next hundred years. And it's, it's really interesting thinking about it both, you know, the philosophical implications for like what we owe ourselves and future generations, and also just thinking about, you know, taking this seriously and thinking about How likely is Something like this to happen, but it has like a little over a year ago. I think this is an important topic. I think it's when we don't, you know, people don't talk a lot about it, but it's a really important if you think about LTD and implications, like, you know, think about us and like, future generations and future Generations forever and like, what we could accomplish versus what we could not accomplish. If we, you know, are not careful, take care of ourselves and and, and protect each other and protect ourselves protect humanity. And he takes it very seriously and then thinks about it and shows that this is something that we should all take seriously. And I think that really resonated with me, it's something I thought about informally before, but I had never seen someone like right eloquently and intelligently of it. Yeah, I think I think I learned the kind of thing from before. I think this is something, the world should take very seriously, right? We're at a kind of, I think he convincingly are using the book about an important inflection point right now, where we, you know, what mazing technological breakthroughs are occurring and the future for Humanity. Could be extraordinary really bright with like amazing Technologies in an amazing potential outcomes. For many generations, colonizing to see no other galaxies and then super-intelligent. Artificial intelligence. Like all these things. I could have huge benefits for Humanity, right? At the same time. These things are risking the increase, the odds of a sort of human-caused Kalama. So think seriously about like, what are some sources that we're devoting to, you know, taking seriously these downside risks, this existential risk as he talks about in the book and I think he's very convincingly makes the point that, you know, one we should value. Generations, much more than we are. And to, we're not investing enough in and thinking about the seriously, and it's not, I mean, he does, talk about climate change. It's like more of the big four ice that he quantifies and talks about. But it's also things like super-intelligent artificial intelligence nuclear woke, his lack of non-proliferation or just an accident, which is almost happened. You don't happen. Almost 2:15. This is important. This is serious, is something everybody should care about is something. Everybody should, you know, think more about whether times are for policymakers or just Society in general. It's something we should all be taking not, no worries. That's right. That's exactly right. Yeah. I know he touched. So keep those are some of the bigger threats. He talks about. He talks about you do manufactured like a human-made pandemic. He talks about like Super Bowl, glazing how thorough he is. An interesting thing is it's a wonderful blend of kind of like philosophy and just thinking about like what we owe ourselves and then like future generations and also just thinking quantitatively seriously about like how, how serious are these risks and you put numbers on Venus lie, there, his best guess is that they're just orders of magnitude, but but there are really reasonable totally in a reasonable and my grounding science and grounded in social science. So it's, it's I'd recommend, I think this is something. We know, we should all talk more about. We should all think more about whether it's in our own way in terms of like our priorities for our policies. Like it's something I think everybody because it's about humanity and the future of humanity, and I can't think of a person that that, that's not relevant or three words. I felt, you know, Pete's like my interest. And I felt like illuminated. Like, I've learned old and also, just a little bit nervous. It's not a super, sorry to go beyond three words here, but it's, it is any doesn't reach the conclusion that humanity is doomed and not far from it. It's just you, you start to realize like these things are serious, and we're not taking them that seriously and we should be You know, probably by putting more money and resources into taking steps to to think more about it. Try to take steps to prevent these things to work. And in that yeah, that wasn't a little bit like I guess just worried.  Okay. Well, thank you, but I was a lot of fun.

I'm going to talk about the idiot by Ali Fateh men, which I checked out from the Claremont College library, but regrettably, they don't have the jacket on it. So but it is and it follows her. As she navigates, her freshman versity and it's actually semi-autobiographical Road. It partially actually during her own first year at Harvard and a scholar of Russian literature. And so she's inspired by kind of long winding stories in which nothing really happens and her book kind of takes cover on it, discusses the passing of time and let me know how to get new space it and our own identities versus those around them. So I first read this book and junior year. I had found even earlier in my college career because I think Good job, speaking to build reflecting on her own experience and it shows first-year students that it's okay to different than the other students around you. And we all have our own experience things in different ways. And I think especially the Claremont colleges that something that we really benefit from hearing from ya. So, this book, I found this book during a period of my life was trying to get back into reading. And that's partly why I wanted to share this book for the subjects to see him Sears, try to want to read for fun more, and then they pick up novels like war books, like War and Peace dense, policy-oriented academic text. And in reality, I think reading is not the same reading. Any book is not the same. When I learned to find books, that really spoke to my interest or spoke to fiction that spoke to where I was at in my life to incorporate reading more into my day. Play practice. And this book was swamped the right book at the right time. It offers almost a philosophical, the meaning of life, and the meaning of our experience and call him or anything. So, it's just a wonderful. It can be a bit slow at times but I think that it also very much speaks to life and at the possible as well. I would recognize the students who early, like I said before, it really speaks to kind of that first year and candid way. It's funny. It's awkward. There is a very slow painful romance throughout the nuns room. I think it's enjoyable for people of any age. I think one of them, it's the type of Novel where once you put it down on feel like you're immersed in the character's perspective. And so I felt very curious about what would happen next if I think I hungry for Best first novel with time to read, but her to write sequel I think has been for quite some time. So perfect.

Sure, I'm done the dean of students here and I am going to talk about a book called written by rabindranath mystery. Sure. So this is a book that takes place in 1975 at a time when Indira Gandhi was the Prime Minister of England. She put an emergency order in place on the country that lasted for almost two years in which all kinds of upheaval, of the Detention of political opponents, for sterilization, economic upheaval. All kinds of things were going on in the country at that point. And this story follows four characters from really different backgrounds. Who is Paz, kind of unwittingly, clay, go through life during this time. Okay, so I came across a fine balance about 5 years ago at the recommendation of one of my good friends. Here is one of the bleakest  Kind of depressing books that I've ever met yet in them, kinds of humor, and all kinds of Hope. And you walk away from the book Feeling. Sort of simultaneously fearful can be. And that in the end, the the goodness of people can actually Prevail and things can turn out. Okay. Sure, the world right now feel very volatile. There's a lot of nuts. I'm a little bit out of control the systems that I used to feeling really under. I think there's a real lack of one another and governments and and things that people can rely on for some sort of stippled. When I got that this story on book is not fictitious and turns of the time in India was only forty-five years ago. And I think there's something to be learned from this story that we'd tentative to what is going on to be attentive to our own agency. Good of things that are otherwise really discuss and to take care of Mystique the, the ballet.  You look good in my book is not for the faint of heart. I think that a reader who wants to pick up a fine balance needs to board to kind of go in for the Long Haul book. It's dense. It simultaneously looks at really big fiends and really minut details, not all of which are Pleasant. In fact much of the book is very unpleasant, but it was kind of a stark, you know Vision, but also able to hang in there. Be there so many threads of good that it's worth hanging in there with them at 1 for just a second. I need to just think about I think I  Yeah, it's a what three words have I get a how I would like to scribe through. I think that I had this really kind of heightened awareness of power at the end of the book.

Just realized everything I do is everything I say is a compositional a relaxed when some collection of my thoughts Solutions.  I'm not sure if I beat you.  I would have to leave for the manifestation of the place of all things and got like some strange thing is that I deliberately place a distance between me and I deliberately tried to present myself. What I truly want to write its is skiing is other than I want to be seeing this great truth. Help me. I want to be seen as and more faster than more interesting. The draft somehow.

I want to exist from different ski, I want to be  I mean to make I don't feel the result of an accident himself is premised upon my difference prices and everything.

When she was like because Axel isn't Kayaks with lots of traffic risible.  And this sarcastic, you is quite tremendous.  Create tremendous to behold. I just thought of something out of one. I need to add that I need to figure out a way to do a machine learning things have any interest or you know different tones of speech to be labeled things to be attached to set up the queries to the GPT 3 Model.

And I was thinking about this fascinating way and with Thiago everything, y'all go thinks comes to be, right? And not like, thought itself is action. And I was thinking a lot about how the, how, like the culmination of my thoughts. As a young kid who's liked sport in the pan. And that's a really weird the way to have the wages of salvation of our conclusions that we have different points in a life when we have no control or like a critical to stand it. And yet we embody those conclusions and not something that's really interesting to me. I just I just I thought that like one of the most amazing thing about my language.  Record of my existence. I'm thinking about them more and more.

And in a very, really, really interesting why. I mean, pretty much for my thesis is going to be about. I just realized is that like a what I've been writing about what I've been thinking about, this is the idea of of of of creating a fictional to self, you know, like racing on constructing and manifesting the south on the page. How do you actually do that? But what about the technological is driving to, which has always been striving to achieve a total eclipse? It's a totally Eclipse existence in some way.  Dan McCready.

And it's also exciting for me because I see like a and it's high a possibility from like my future research should really, didn't is on the philosophical ground that has been said of knowledge for some time to be really, really brought to the Forefront and Passyunk, have it be like it's something that was so interesting and it's so interesting in DVD 3D to manifest.  My language is mint. You know, she bring in some way like a complete manifestation of of my off my off. My thought patterns language is normally that language is normally like these, you know, right. They are placeholders that hold some kind of meaning beyond that they refer to it. And in that stream together, they become something large and they communicate something to you. But language itself is data, but what this is doing the generative language model is that it takes your language and from that language recreates. So it's like life it like language is full of life and flee with the Apple probabilistic sort of like  Gas station, I am fucking impregnating my language and and that is that is Jen.  I'm going to be watching so fucking hot mess and it's got him. It's going to be, it's going to be like a complete manifestation of my thesis is the creation of the bacta is myself. So I will be fully and totally manifest cuz my thesis exists is language. Language thing to use body language model of this language Mobile in the same way. And you can communicate with my thesis. You can have a direct conversation about the store with my mobile, which is like the Theses itself is is is is is more than just a thesis itself is alive and that it's fascinating. It's so it's, so it's so fucking matter. If I will, do use it. That fucking that fucking pun.  It's fascinating abilities and it's actually like fractions, which I haven't even pulled something for right to just because it says like takes what I'm saying, and it's all probabilities to Disney's different. Now is in the network. It is, it is, it's doing an act of interpretation and giving me back sort of like what I am saying without sort of like, without the saying, you know.  Is collecting this data about, that's what I'm trying. That's what I, that's what I'm trying. That's my next right? I'm trying, I'm trying to connect experience in sometimes but why? I mean that I'm trying to make the state to ask as complicated as I can and to do so I need to actually I'm currently trying to walk on a machine learning model that can take cement at the sentiment analysis.  Defensive lineman, I don't think is handsome.  That's a great idea. I'm going to get one and I'm going to attach it to for Ali to my thesis and so fascinating as in tracking. So like OK how to sort of like differences in heart rate to what what I'm saying, you know, I'm through some different heart rate, you know, I cannot see some of the scribes. I can figure out what, you know about temora the great idea. Thank you.  The polygraphs ride because you are. There is in times of emotions, is there are so many factors at play. Right? It's the whole existence. He know I think my one of my biggest problems currently is, is the institutional. It's, it's about the fact that like, I need to get approval to do experiments on humans. Right? And I don't need to do it. If it's an experimental. Myself problem is is that if I'm really to make my models Martha, I have to have him, put an output. I have to, I have to make up my friends, you know, not to stop by or or I have to like it got a more powerful microphone, the captures a little bit more of my surroundings, you know, and then uses that information for that from them.  And some input into my mobile. We got a very philosophical question here about the about like, is it is what people say, I'm going to conducting an experiment. If I am use, if I'm using this beat right to, if I am using this beat like, is it, is it free to take people's speech in California. It's it's illegal in New York is not illegal to record now. Yeah, that's right. It's about saving the knowledge of the day.  I am wondering if it's even necessary to get, like input to get like what other people say, right. It would make the model smarter and it would make it able to communicate. But it doesn't necessarily, which is just like in regards to one's health or in regards to any other problem. Is that, right? That would complicate introduce something to it. But, and but the thing is, is that like what I realize is that, like, implicitly in doing that, and I did to do that on Mine by a text conversation with sanjana. I haven't built models on that. Since like, the beginning of our relationship, where we could really text on Facebook, Messenger me that you can download that on the model of tangent equation to model of me.  Implicitly and creating a model of me. I am creating a model of songs in her response to some kind of, I noticed modeling myself, anytime I end modeling at anything at all. And so, that's another philosophical question about sort of like, like, I'll be able to be able to find out like that question. But like it that like it needs to be at work right now.  Something less completely lost Jeff lights.  My backup phone, I was using backup phone and then I something else. Doesn't answer spitting on somebody. So great, like everything. I've owned it.  So, I was right.  Is very long fucking for me about this. You can text that. Oh my God, what the fuck? That's so cool.  That's it came out looking like you do. Okay.  AT&T mobile T-Mobile birth. Occasionally goes on the top of the Ring caused. By the way. I needed to do my room just smoke until I put the excellent open, just doing computer.  I mean, it's it's the first of all text messages from still come as just a text messages from my phone. It's still going to beat you up. If you don't have to have like a good to like watch movies and stuff.  Holy shit, gimbal mode.  Or I bought the fuk yo, what the fuck is this phone in? The this is the weirdest thing. I really like it, though. It's very cheap through plus plus, I'm thinking about, I need to be able to log on my phone because for a lot of some of the data collection stuff. I want, I want to be like hop dating live until. I'm also going to be me. I know, I'm going to need to change.  That's like a high attack. I might even if like code and like, mechanically, like engineer. My Own Thing, by the way, if, if, by any, if you are walking in engineering Athol, I would love some help, and it could be, it could be, it could be a cool project. You'd be, you'd be on the on the recent PayPal publish, whatever you'll know. He'll be credited as as it would be if you do you would got part of the stipend. No payments. I got from like different Fellowship himself. If ever you want to get into actual engineering shit like I would because I I cannot do everything I can talk to you know, but that's like a Linguistics and natural language processing right now in addition, to sort of reading like a whole bunch of philosophy that I've never had before all these disciplines before January.  I don't like I asked Samantha to the old vets have to be like integrate in this very specific system, you know, and I have to figure out a way to look live communicate, you know would like a metric what I need is like some kind of like maybe cobbled together from other machines, a full data collection system affecting your heart rate, your heart rate to or maybe some kind of like all the other metrics might be also real time. Connecting whatever. Also consistently getting the times of adjusted because they drift that's like a Time draft on me. Sit on these things while I can gas off the time because it has it. So it's a really interesting like a problem engineering wise, which can be cool.  By the way, this is so I will still try to look like a. It's like a real a real life experiences to spend it in the next. Yes, because there is no Financial so you won't be able to get to safety choice now so you don't have it.

I am not sure how much my parents because my parents pay for my brother's mosses and I'm paying for my my and I'm getting a PhD and so I won't have to pay for my sis begging to be using that money that they would have been paying back to supplement to my rent Rite.

And like you can just walk in like stay that and you wouldn't have to pay living expenses, which might be able to, which might cut down the call. Me. I'm not sure how I'm not sure how my parents would react to this. But I think, I think in the sentence, I'm not sure if they especially well. Now, I'm not sure if they would be like, if it really comes to like, a financial bind and like your, your, your future would be like, you know, what you have to do. Like some weird fucking program somewhere or whatever, you know, if I'm saucin that they would also give you and give you a like a zero interest loan type and wish they would. Like I'm not in that way. And I know that they would. I know that they would that would be  That wouldn't that wouldn't be. That wouldn't be Heartland. I just mean that likely even in the slightest way if I'm going to be at Columbia and I'm going to have that like that space so I can talk can reduce your expenses enough like about to like I would I would you be very welcome to stay with me and that case it wouldn't have to even be like, you know, and then that would ban you use it you can use it.

Did he land from Adam and then share the final with me before you post it in case I say something really stupid which of the following topic sentence in the recording? So it's just like with what the prompt is for that or like. There's nothing visual like would you? otherwise, I'll see if  I think, yeah, I know. That's great. I think if you, if you said tell us a little bit about the, what was the basic problem for the whole exercise is like the books that was it for.  The favorite book. My favorite. Yeah, because when I first saw they were talking about recent books. I thought that was like a little bit about to go, but brought the Bible memorized.  I think it will help me and you'll get probably better footage. If, if we're engaging a kind of conversation. Tell me that book about and and then you said, why did you why did you love this? But I have a couple of things that I would point out and then let's see what we get out of it. Is that  So, how are you? Do you need me to hit the song? Yeah. Okay. So apparently, I read the book. I read the book because Priya had invited, can to speak at the app. In part about this book. The book is a story of others. One Israeli one Palestinian who eat tragically lose his daughter in the israeli-palestinian conflict. And I was initially intrigued because Priya told me that if her a part of her Athenaeum series, the author brings both dad's to zoom or buy some really compelling. So I need it. No, I haven't. But free is expecting to have, can come this spring and I'm hoping that we can arrange to have both Dad's izoom because that's a commitment of, can we?  Give the presentation is to bring the major figures in the book To Life for his audience. This is July's, the count of their story, but it is also a factual novel. And so, one of the things I love about this is it is in some ways things. I love about the novel is about real facts, real stories, but it's, of course, very creative. First of all, I love books that have a strong emotional impact and the story of Two Dads losing their daughters and their friendship and what they learn from one, another about the conditions in which they is really, really compelling. And I love the geometric abstraction of the book. A paragon is a shape with an infinitesimal number of sides or angles. And that's a wonderful metaphor for thinking about the Middle East conflict. No matter how you look at all from which to view a word.  I love some of the literary techniques in the book. So the chapters aren't really chapters. And instead of there being 10 or 20 there, which is a tribute to a thousand and the fragments all go with all of the stores start in, ascending order all the way to 50 in descending order, all the way back to one love structure and geometry. I was really intrigued by the bring lecture and Innovative literary techniques to tell this very troubling. Tragic, beautiful story. So, well, this is a book humans. It's a book about how in the unthinkable tragedy, how to men manage to human a conflict through their own and shared from the how they've chosen love over the kind of  He'd and content usually under those vile at the moment for us all through. If we does that keep us from getting along people seat in a way. It seems like this is just one of many conflicts in the world that week on a daily basis. May be in some ways not as accentuated her severe, but certainly a universal human conditions. A paragon is a wonderful way into the Middle East conflict, but it teaches us to look at all conferred to Brent to bring other people together who otherwise, I'll just transferring the Federation to the recommended to all audiences. Actually. I mean, it's for people who aren't interested, It's a Wonderful. It's a Wonderful illustration of The Human Experience in the middle again, I would, I would ask everyone to read this book to reflect on the cars in our own Society.  And the ways in which it's so cold people on the other side of that conflict in some form of contempt, or to be extensive of hatred towards those Cooper in that way. It's a very powerful human out in the human.  Yeah.  Because I was by the story.  S. I was very inspired and you think about things that we need to do and do together. Keep us separate people held up a creative impulse. I was really intrigued literary style of the book and the use of fragments and little tangents on birds in the story, but were so deeply integrated into the Yeah. Yeah. Yeahs.

It's titled like the Dreamhouse as something and so kind of atom that has like and it's different ways of story to end this summer. With my girlfriend decided. It wasn't Club. Miss was the book that she yeah. I think it was just like for that for me to see people speaking up about issues. It happens them justly different for gotcha.  Yeah, makes a sophomore at CMC and the book that I chose to share with you guys is in the it's a memoir by Carmen Maria Machado who is in this relationship. It's really great. Is amazing and interests through domestic abuse by her partner down into little chapter titled, the Dreamhouse as I have like a different title and some of them are metaphors. Some of them are little and indifferent. Push the story along this summer with my girlfriend. And we had any book was the first book that she chose me read it together. I think it's really important for people to raise, because everybody has different backgrounds and different things have happened to them. And I think representation is something that is very important to me. So, I just lie and you know, different types, TV movies, books. Anything. I feel like it's extremely important.  To see our present, lgbtq novels and even one that talked about, you know, domestic violence. Because that's not very, and it's a very, very commonly expressed the lgbtq community, but within everybody too. And so it really spoke to me, you know, I'm domestic violence Survivor for sexual assault Survivor, but I was still able to relate to aspects of the Buzzy some of the stuff, a child really important to get that message across, you know, give a little as possible to find a way.  Who did I learned? It was something that was like, emphasize was a little bit more aware of was just like, people's, he's hurt. Cuz there's like, a part of the talks, about a court case, in which this black lesbian, had the violence and like, out of self had ended up killing pleaser, right? And she ended up going to jail for that. Was completely, positive wasn't seeing as self-defense of court and just seeing with the different types of discrimination that can happen.  Like based on different aspects of people like that. And that was something that I was aware of, but not to the nursing book for anybody who is Ritz ton of different styles of is even like a choose-your-own-adventure pretty interesting. Even if you are a victim of you know, domestic violence like you can still into it and you're so mean.  Thank you so much. ",504,11/30/21,211130_001_me.wav

So Department spirit and fire that said, if I think is like need to do one thing I didn't notice about about like it says that liked is that the only get tougher environments to, it's fun with serious Ashley and in a very real way, there is no seriousness to Someone Like, You know, a Ting Define at see how there is no likeness is because you realize that, like, all of them are like, like, all that causes about doc fucking shit. The time you think about these, you know, that's just absolutely.  Brutal truth, you know, the way of life in a way that like, they're not serious. Oh, yeah, like I was with him. And I noticed that even like my own.  Exactly. It's not like 311 in order to human it down. What are the problems are guarding against set of like his heart. It's like so far this how you get some good Consulting.  Feel like getting to the right place at exactly. It's the biggest bulshit that exists. Like, psychologically, stressful time is in the past week, in the past, like, six messed up during the recruitment season. For like, like, logical stressing. There's no, like, like low-income go like, you know, who got a good job on April 9th to the 13th. If you look at like the context of know it, like I I like fully agree with it, take you out but it's hardly been the same way like in the same time like it.

By the way, the land is like that, like spiritual, like whatever.  66% stake holder in this massive pipeline episode of, like, reservation land and the problem, but it's like the thing is, if you want to appeal to see and see if you would say that, like, oh, this is a clear violation of private property violation of every single, like whatever like and it's going to like several several different. Holy sites and talk about land and religion being, can I stay at the hotel? But the difference would like there is a sense of my place. While we're at practice, has it taken out from this land.

No offices has like presents in the music cuz that's the only place that she could be present. Cuz that would just like horror horror. So like her entire life, her entire presents exists in every single like syllable. Every single thing that she says and then there's no sense of like all I'm going to be famous. I want to be seen, there's no whatever there was no nothing else. Yes. No, I don't know any of the office to exists like that.

And it's just when I'm writing it when it's just I am completely this I'm not present. You know, I am fully not fully manifest in this coming out. There is no Greater Joy.

I mean that's like selling fucking Christian. That's what Jesus wanted his like things that he overthrew. He like he's doing the Temple Salt Lake instead of make doing business in the temple and he you know through over like a table and I was just pulled out. Like, as he was manifesting. I disagree my place this Infamous the entire. If you read the Old Testament, being the entire thing has to do with that, you can capture God, God is not in control. You know, you, you had something that you have to just just accept an existence exists within. There is no like human grappling and there's no, I Dollar Tree.  Idolatry against physical manifestation of God. The temple thing is against the physical manifestation, as well as a physical manifestation of God, which is like the peak idle. It's meant to be God's not meant to be manifested, and it's meant to be, it's like not good or bad to put it in Christianity. It separates into Satan and God Mom. It is a manifestation of his direct Channel, you know, but instead the oldest theology rising and all this would have been trying to walk out to the distance y'all to see trying to make call. Absolutely good. And I like, how can you recognize recognized file?

He created as well as the beauty of the flower, you know, as well as the whatever. And he just describes all of this, who I think that you can like understand God's you can understand, you know, about that's jove. That's all that's Old Testament that think I like meaning of it, you know, but Angie and Christianity that like it's like ceases to be like it makes no sense. And that's just like the biggest lack of continuity and instead instead like man is like saved by Jesus. She was a manifest man and garden.  List of like just wanted their own DIY know who is directly accounted for it's, it's, it's, it's total bullshit.

I like whole Capstone project to the Box accounts, and we can also give you the link to that. And so that, like, whenever you guys are ready with the big data and we can you can put that in.  Not that, that, that's perfect that I had generated a whole bunch of fake data. According to the code, could book that I've been playing around with little bit. So I'm getting the real date and just seeing how it looks like. I'm getting all that set up and anything that walks on the 10 million will also walk on the logic on the lodge of De set as well.

So I was, I was wondering, I had a question or two about the code book. I've ever bought a couple of the new roads that I saw. So,  When you say so, I sold that damn motorcycle into the psychographic segments. And I understood that that's really useful useful base. I was wondering like, how they get those, why how those were generated, how like reliable are they in, in terms of like how would they created? Like the series love the balanced multi device?  Okay. Yeah.... That's really helpful to know that. That's fantastic. And and it's the segments are predicted based on the accounts, not based on the profile on Mariah Carey.  Yeah. That makes sense. That's useful to because I knew if we if we see that something's a household with the young kids and then we see that that's like, you know, young superhero fan as a taste of a segment, you know, you can probably he's out that that might not have to be the whole household for that. Just maybe  Okay, so the remote no kids in this, so, okay. So then so that's a, if that's a household with young kids and then the taste but then then we can pop some fun stuff in that. That makes sense. That was also  Yeah, that makes sense. So in the profile pipe on, when it says general orchids the profile type calling that's always going to be General. Okay?  Okay.  That makes sense, the deserts of the partners series id, call him that I didn't remember seeing before, and I was a little confused about what that meant.  Okay. Yeah, you can shut screen. Let me see if I can, I've never  Yeah, let me see if I can make cohost okay at your co-host now, so you should probably be able.  Yeah, I see it now.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay. So how is that different than series full title?  Okay.  Okay, okay.  Right.  Right.  That make that makes a lot of sense. Yeah, that's perfect. That's really helpful. So, I guess the Lost call him that I have a question about is the scripted unscripted.  And like some reality TV type.  Okay. That makes sense. And when you say the number of times the program was watched my last question about that was if something was wrong.  That's the number of times. I get specific program. This is not it's not like serious Y. Is it just like how many times you watch? The particular app is like that to take care of that?  Mickey movie. Okay. Yeah.  Stop. Make that makes a lot of sense. I think that.  Okay, and what what's the difference between watch and played?  Okay.  Yes, that was my next question.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  Sit with someone. What? Exactly. So you said that kind of. And like Latin American Latin America. So exactly the general entertainment limits.  Oh.  Okay.  Right.  So it's so just to make sure that I got this. So that if you are in the US and Latin America, all of this adults and all the contents is like, actual contact us not made by Disney lives on Disney Plaza, worse elsewhere, outside of the US and that's okay.

It's one of those things were going to be very very quick. I sent to, you know, like a very very quick Ascent to sort of a manager position.  Yeah, but the thing is like, I feel like meeting so you do deal with some shit like that and doing like you doing like that kind of like whatever they can set up like a walking for like, yeah, you can just jump up.  The thing is that you need to just find a little bit of the technical side so you can speak the language.  Y'all and I saw something like that and dropping the scales at like that. This is, don't don't go for the other job.  If I'd known the best places to be at the beginning of like a real like this, you know.  I think it's one of those things where, like, project for them.  no, I mean, the only worried that if it's like, if they're like, if that just like doing this in, like, like Buck around, so it'll be a little bit and like,  Retirement.  By the way, did you get an even distribution of this yet?  Weehawken.  I know I'm not pong Jetta.  Again, I'm going to take a piss.  Like the thing is is that like I'm pretty sure that the only reason I'm I'm going to do a PhD in the main reasons. It's cute.  Because I'm not done with this place. You know, I'm not in times of school. I don't feel like I don't like the way I feel like I'm battling on the anyting. You know, what is a cool thing is that when you're walking like you're like in the process also like walking.  That is true like as in like the thing, this was one of those things where like Facebook will be like yo what Frost while I guess I'm not, you know, like doing like psychological like, you know, he has this is sort of like, you know, it's one of those things where you at you and you can like you that you have like a lot of possibility.  The other thing is that, I'm not.  But like it's it's a it's a fight to file a criticism. I'm just, I'm just worried. I am a little worried about that. That's why I'm like, I'm wondering if I should do the stuff but like going to the lab like as like, I know. You know what I mean?  Synthesis of the see, the place that they have somewhere, the coolest, the coolest place. I really shouldn't be out. Is the MIT media lab.  But the problem is is I hate Boston, like, with my top.  Association. But I also think I'd rather be like, in like Neil Perry, like Prince in the album.  That's out here.  But the same time also means that I have a method of have like a little bit of a  I know, who knows, if I'm going to be somewhere for 5 years. I don't want to be it over like close to a sort of like family and my friends and just happening got like being around your family for a little bit like that. We got fucking valuable.  No, you can go home for like a fucking launch. A fantastic. If I'm going to be somewhere like that extended. Of time and place was like be around his family too. So it's like,  hey, you don't have and I do I have like  Then the oven on.  You have the oven on.  Yeah, go down. Like I'm feeling I'm wondering if it is like the right decision. It's sort of like one of those things why like  That was like the sense that like it's like I'm like, you know, like a like a race or something like that in, like a video game. Line, but like mold, not like imagine if you have to stop to activate this ability.  But when you do activate the ability, it's just like, you know, I'm by this fucking slingshot and you just fucking Flyers up to this, to the front, you know what I mean?  I'm not sure if that's the right right, call. Let me know.  Yeah, but for me, it feels like the sounds like I don't have to do it. Even if I like the fact that I have a Ph.D.  You know, it's one of those things where you can like you can always like fullback in the fact that like, you really fucking like and something, you know what I mean? It's like, you know.  how much more because it's very  other made, you know, I'm the maid.  it is still interesting to me because it's  pretty traditional measure of 60.  But at the same time, it feels like an office. I think that's like extremely set of like right now and think very like and see.  Somehow with like it's like you do business in like it stopped up and like it song out feels like the more radical Roots. I mean  Someone who thinks for I did like the possibility of just sitting down, actually crazy thing, like a new systems and structures and so happy.  They are in 3 years or something. I might be like holy shit. I was wrong.  Off of what? My thing is not like I only got to that position and then like, it might be another big thing. Is that like, I never want that feeling that like, I am doing is because of like my dad of cooking. My privilege, you know, and all the time of nation, have you have that PhD, you know, and I can stop something off of that pot phone without needing to sort of like, think about even be in the my like like. Success is purely my own.  Yeah, that's not anybody else's.  Yeah, I mean, of course, I mean there is something like the fact that I went to college and  Yeah, and it feels like I kind of want to like, I would like. Like a collective or like all like  I do not like it. So kind of like company or something like that off the woods. If I walk through it like I'll be done by the time and be like  Fucking like a fucking knowledge. You not like, I'll be late fee, like ready to bust.  Around it.  Do job thing. Like all the fucking think I'm like, yeah, the problem is that most people use that time to reduce their existence.  Yeah.  That's why I like being forced to do things like one. I'm like, on by myself and like not like being forced.  Some imagined or real structure around.  Totally fall off the rails. The thing is, is that like part of my weed like, I'm not like an unstructured on out of the system type of person. Ultimately, ultimately, it's only like on a super structured in the way in which I have like I living within my own and tongue, you know what I mean?  How do you say in Spanish?  Yeah, I just have that like this and thought I wanted.  Snow bike.  No expectations. It was crazy that conversation with Simon last night.  it's just what to say Reckoning between like the different parts of life funeral and it really unlike the thought that like, you know, like  I just feel like sometimes I feel like suffocated in his Endeavor. It's like someone isn't just like a possum that self-contained that spirit is like contained inside their body, and they move like a goodbye.  Self-contained like a person know what happens when you like living with someone like swimming in like that wara, you know, and then. Like ideas of themselves and ideas for the future and ideas of what a wild and so I feel like I'm drowning not yet so I can hang with this blah. That's the same reason. Why like, I don't think we can like I'm just that we can't really say I like towels like when we really know someone like we don't know. How attractive is your sister, you know, it's absolutely.  There is a sense in which I am sick of his.  Moralizing and his lack of he doesn't see me. I don't, I don't like he sees composite me, but it is evidently clear from the conversation yesterday, but he has no fucking clue who I am. I guess. I've never put it.  And I want some of these spend so much time with someone. And if I could like he just fundamentally like  And that would be what you like reducing my whole existence to save my relationship with CNC, you know. Like it it's all has something to do with my  Just like Dawson senior. Like he, he like, has some kind of, like, knowledge of me in the way in which I react, but he has no fucking clue who I am. And that way, you know, who I am as a soul.  Yes, exactly.  Like I definitely don't think he understands like like my life in my death in the difficulties. I'm going through like a real positive experiences. Totally, Miss recognizes me.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah.  And lots and lots. Ultimately like my big problem when that's a problem with him. I like I just wanted to like on this to end like I fucking I thought yeah, that's a great idea. Like I fucking I fucking like, you know, and I feel like I feel like I see him and I'm trying like my really fucking hot to stand but he just like  He lapsed into you, you know, but he never liked latched onto me, you know, in this way.  Like more 10th. No, I mean, I mean lot, strong and strong like understand your way of living.  Somehow it's like, it feels like it.  He like tried to buy life, trying to live you along the way. You live with Junior. Amy, even not like that. Like, I didn't feel like existed and maybe that's what's a false. I'm not, I'm just, I'm just walking speculate that these are not like the idea isn't this is like recent like really recently that I'm like very much feeling the sense that like, I don't think he understands me on hold and that's a really just tough position to be with someone who's like, I'm about like lack of understanding that's like the primary like fundamental thing to me. You're right. And I also think you're one of the people Henderson  I think I understand someone else more than me. That's a true.  Immediately reduces until you saw things that you could like.  And it's going to be like old like fucking like $2,000 an hour or two.  6909 thing is like I walked points shed and like about wanting to work for like company that develops like musically like and I'm like, let me finish my point, you know, I'd start saying something and eventually and I was like you were doing that this like thing like you and he would start talking.  Is that he like? Yeah, he doesn't see beyond his own Wald and that's like a drawing of someone, doing the venetians and changing the teaching and whatever. It's not pronounced like that. But if this is like, how I'm buying it was invented, 71 not busy or not sick, split line and a full line and so different combinations of split line, full lines and codes different meanings of that. Sort of, like, I finally came from it, just like the root of like, computer systems, like poetry and divination last like, everything to me.  But I'm just more questioning about like, okay, as we move out into the, what does it mean to have a relationship with someone? I'm trying to figure out like  like I love him so much, but at the same time, I just  Yeah.  Shepton High beautiful with me with them really not like, you know what I mean? Like he doesn't know what to do when like you're going through something. He doesn't really actually use like the whole part. I was not like, oh like the car crash happened. He gets up and leaves.  I just hate his moralizing.  Like ultimately, like I can more lies about him to you sometimes, you know.  Poppy Mountain. What she like more Eliza's.  You copy holier-than-thou. You just have to be hold me, you know and it's like it sounded good but like it.  Dude, I'm sorry. This is like the doctrine of Judaism. It's literally like people like most people it's not like when I was told that I was like, well, there has been some values in something from the very beginning.  It's like the ultimately I would just like getting sick of it because I looked it. I looked at in in in the fucking face, if I know it's on Fast through the fucking stop it, but I just need this one. Just described as the amount of emotion that was going on, you know, at this point in time and I pulled out the book, The Old Testament laws of holy war was going to put out in which they literally murdered like so many Palestinians, you know, in the in the in the take in this, in the taking of land has promised to them by God, you know, and it was like and how they like toast them and then ma did like, you know, four hundred people here. And then they ate they tricked them out of the city and they bought the whole city down and kill all the children in the good book.  Like I'm seriously Jackson morale. You know, like like like it's like, it doesn't exist. It's not like, I don't even believe that. Like killing is like a bad thing. No, it's like  Yeah.  Call human-created. No, we don't.  And he's like, living.  Never look up at the window, you know, the shop, you know, you never fucking like realize that he's on the fucking shit.  Yeah, I know. But yes, I'm parking lot it look outside the window and be like, yo.  Sonia Mendoza.  Young.  will being symbol of owl to ultimately,  and I think,  I know but the thing wasn't that like he was spending the whole time or lightning against whole time. I wasn't saying anything about him, but ultimately like I did say it when I said the thing about the most depressing thing about seeing say is that people to consign themselves to be that parents?  I know, but I thought about all the people, all the things that I never really got tense when I told him told him about like,  I was talking about like Zack new phone that like sexual assault on campus. And now that was like one of the main things, I like how like I sold them people coming out in like a demon is why we know and he's like, oh, there's someone that you would missing on that list, right? To avellino, you know, and that seemed like a smart child, rapist accuser, you know, that rapist rapist no accuser a rapist.  Get like, you know, whatever and that's when he really got pissed and his fucking put his hook on the lots of such a good thing. They said, you know, the put a pacing is hooked on the fucking re he's been without the full months and he's already like it.  It's Park in 4 minutes.  4 minutes.  I do that sometime from Atlanta but like nothing is on. But, since you seem to think everything is about like it's been like 4 months. Like he's like I'm like what the thing is ultimately these places and whatever and not stable, you know in like a fucking like shaking piece of ice.  Applying for.  Who's the main fucking thing that they're looking for it? Or they're not looking for, like a fucking, like, people commercial real estate Consulting. Are you people skills code?  It was downloading data sets, one by one on toys computer than one. By one copying the road like 200 times off the fucking grab all the data sets at once. It's right through it and do it. And now I'm taking an extra like maybe 5 minutes to get it fixed up. And I was like his entire session like coding for like 6 hours and, you know, get milk. He doesn't want to like long or like the new skills. Yeah. I know. And I think it's the ultimate like he's not going to be technical. It was like, alternative. Doesn't know the technical either. Do you actually a plane?  And ultimately, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm trying to say. He's walking wrong.  I'll get us a people skills.  I don't know. I mean.  I think it was a social, like, anything you just fucking like fall behind. Ultimately. It's like, it just, like, pisses me off to hearing like moralizing. I don't take advice from people less successful, but it like it almost hit the spot like the most, like stupid fucking shit. It was a new so annoying, the hair and moralizing against me when he has like like walking life in order. I don't like anyone. I know.  Like submit to the certainties of Gene Simmons, quote. I have no plans that involve any chance not like the tremble thing is that he has been changing. The has been getting better and he has been what I thought, but what really breaks me. It's his, the way that he sees me, like, I'm sorry. It says like, how can you beat? Like, I have a friend that you've known for this long and it seemed like that, you know, he called me yesterday.  Conversation.  I know it's try to send like, oh, so you think you're better than any call me a fucking asshole in like, how God, like it. Honestly makes me look weird to feel about like my friend. It makes me. So this is what they had a friend, a friend, say something like that. Lets me fucking honest. And even with the whatever. I just I just fucking like, nothing even like for it like I just looked at him. I'm like it. I think honestly like you and you be lying if you don't think that's the case, you know, an ultimately I think that is what it comes down to that in the subtext. There's actually like a like a big fucking war going on between like two different ideologies and ultimately does the Samsung it sounded like I  I am criticizing his entire fucking way of living and his entire fucking time from something. You just hooked onto. I know, I know. But the thing is, is that like him.  And it's just like this is an ideological war dying on, you know, in the subtext of which like I just see him like he told me about the time when she stopped dreaming.  Like a couple weeks ago, like your fucking like whatever you're dreaming, you say, he's like he told me about the moments in which he had this realization. They stop streaming and realized it was stupid. Yes.  Dreams for yourself is not strange that with, no, that was stupid. It wasn't like, sometimes. If I can, you know, my brother thinking that my brother was behind has like the extremes of stupid but like for a different reason though, it's like this is like the dream and body, you know, like there is no there is no dream. There is no. They told me that it was in freshman sophomore year. It was like with his history stuff and he realize that like the history stop like it like it, it wasn't.  All these ideas about like, you know, history and it's like its place within its and Ike has on his whatever. He he. He just said that he asked him one day and he woke up and he was just, it wasn't that he was like, oh it's gone. The tile. Didn't, you know like that. Did you like the kind of dreams that sounded like will do whatever and you just woke up and he said, and he realized he has reached the wrong conclusion.  It's only fucking double down and got real. Like that sense of like it's gone.  Ultimately, he has given up on on on, and on anything. That's not what other. And the only thing he cares about is is, is going to be like family and comfort and the two different WhatsApp to T sideways. I like them scatter the kind of kids he's going, but when he's going to race,  Looking like selfish, you know, concert.  Just as bad as like your relationship being wrong, until you have a baby.  Because forever, there's that going to be a kid with them and that suspicion might get a little quieter.  I think there's some part of me deep down.  and ultimately, like,  She just need like a lot here. It's like I can't even imagine something like that. The devastation my face when I keep giving up one day and realize those two things of childhood. It was, it was like what's going on? I just didn't know when it happened, but it just happened and ultimately decide. If you're going to grow up someday. He told me and you. The pop that like, pissed me off, and that's the papa just made me so fucking angry and has been me again and again, and again. And again, he thinks he reached some kind of like conclusion for himself and like in like in freshman year and he's been hovering the sense of like superiority that like I am going to, I am like you like it's like that. Like misanthropic like fuck in a box is like spoken to the young life sucks. And you know, who the fuck are you to tell me that, you know, to try to ruin my shit.  Kissinger or no.  And here.  Can you imagine hearing that though? And that's a, that's a fucking clocks of the meth and that made me realize like this guy is like sucking the life out of me.  What does Zaxby's close?  Yeah, I'm not sure about that. I'm going to have a beer outside of something and I'll take a cigarette and you got to walk soon.  Rideable distance, you know what? I mean? I'm just going to come going to piss.  I have a fucken want to write a book, The Warriors.  Yeah, so what?  Don't worry a thing.  Is that such shut sometimes about like you guys being like having some kind of distance you guys?  And that like you guys something makes little comments about like disrespecting. He's like That's so exciting. Disrespectful to you.  Not that I think I think I think he thinks that you put like I think he's like secretly really angry about the re thing. I think you secretly really what was that massive fight that you guys have the beginning of this mess was the covid.  The ultimately things. Like I don't think he thinks that you don't care that. I think about like pop that you're a bit like a bit like selfish and about a bit like, you know, that you that you're trying to like play the social game in a way that like, would put him at the bottom.  I do think younger undervalues Liam's like it's like you're playing like ultimately this is the same thing as with both of us in all. Well with you Papi is it is the wrong one. It's it's it's he understands that in the social game that you play. You know, she's at the social hierarchy in the game that I play outside like the game that I played like unlighted.  You know, he's like a fucking cock, you know, someone has already given up before he started and I was right about that. What you think he is.  One. I think he was it was an example and unsorted to sit you. That's why I like sunlight. And it was not refined. It was ugly. It was like when we were at the club, she was like, there in like Rita's right away and got me out. So, you know,  It was like a fucking like it was for you.  Lake Sahara.  Fine, then, because I wanted, like, I fucking brought him into my Orbit, you know what I mean before or been the thing that pissed me off. As, like, Simon has I can tell you in the boss I think and it's really hard to imagine. How you doing? How you doing? You're off. You shaved. I felt like a princess. I know I just felt. I felt like I fucked. My just I felt so like Sleek. I like her kind of like gravitas to have your hat.  Yeah, it's like a little bit of Gravitas, right? That the chest had I know it's like it's like it's like it's like you know that you know, this is a Greek who has like a like coming out of the top of his shots in the chain. It somehow like badasses. I don't know.  I know that shit. Shit Kyrie's like pheromones, you know, it's like, you know, that shit like has like I was seeing, you know, Fagan. Yeah, they're like short as fuck but he's a fucking tank. I know you. Like I've never understood some of the ideas of that. I was talking to Emily. The other suns in his roommate, and they went to the strip club in the Tropical Lei, a couple date nights ago, and they were like a hugely uncomfortable when they was at know, it was, it was stopping. But the thing is, Emily was like Emily with the crowd, is the mail.  Yeah, and the thing is, is that this these are these guys in the crowd Emily was like, you know, I was thinking of like fucking them. Not because I wanted to like have sex with them. But that was like something like so like visceral about like the sound of that. That's what it's like an grossest. You know, that would have been fun to see like old men in, like, a different way. And it says like, I've never understood why I like women like men. Sometimes, you know, you know, why is that this like this? Like and I started to see it like, with even like the most grossest thing. Like, I don't know. It's like a sound like  Yeah, there's no hot like you. There's no hiding.  And you just fucking yells like his wife?  The thing is that it's a it's kind of, it's kind of gross. Yeah, I know the same reason, like I want to be as I possibly can with my feminine side, you know, that family inside is, if I is often times, it's a fucken, the angel, you know, I knew how that little, like a data Gainesville within you, you know what I mean? I'm like, you know what, they bring out the feminine side and both of them.  Like, I'm not so sure about that man in that kit. Yeah, me too.  I got to wash it to the Lexus. Yes. This is do it.  Thanks for starting this together. This is like savable. We should put these two in like a little.  Vat19.  It's so fun. You know what I mean?  Play, such a fucking, such a fucking thrilled. Do you have that? What was that?  I'm kind of mad that you got that. You got you got you got that check on your credit card and that then the plane tickets. I know it's not it's okay. I wanted to understand my own like feeling is like I didn't really understand why I was feeling this way. You know, it's okay.  Yeah, I know.  12.  Thanks, Lisa.  You kind of like an ass.  Play that song.  It doesn't matter nothing.  Angie's light fantastic on the other guy, really, despite the fact that like  No.  I think she's like, she's really, I don't know if I told you this yet before but like,  Major English teacher vibe.  I really, really like an gymnast. I'm just just  I don't see. The other thing is that like Simon on Sundays are always down.  You mean you can't not the reason why Aunt likes him as well. He's always down to like  Yeah.  And I understand that.  Emily. What is it? What is done? Is that like? I don't really hang out with her anymore like myself and that's like sucks. He's getting his family. Doesn't give like International Aid that he needs it. And so he's like trying to walk out ways to get these scholarships been known to do. The scholarship has to be that unlike that she talked with these people and that's probably the reason why he's, like a massive. Just like I don't care about anything except like I feel like changing my situation. I have so much as back, then ultimately, like he's there was a lot of cultural differences.  Yes, it's so delightful sense of like total unawareness as well.  How to dress. Like I'm really I really like him. I just ate. He is missed and good person and not man.  I know Heath.  Don't do that.  Hey, son, what's up?  You're in the library.  Okay. I'm not in the library. I'm actually walking around the room today because I'm going to be spending some time with us. We're going to go to l.a. At like 4. I have a lot of work to do and I feel like it when it's not like a lot of conversations and stuff. Maybe we can because you can we do that tomorrow. I'm sorry. I might I might be a little like a we'll just this weekend. I'm going to but I'll definitely try to bring it by and doesn't try. That will definitely try to hang out. I love you. Yeah, I think I need to give you some updates at some point. I love you. Take care.  Fight, yeah.  Handsome, Molly. Ali boy.  It would have been crazy to know. You can do it like that side of you. Do you think about that a lot reason?  Android.  Neuroscience PC.  first day of Wisconsin, which is why  Really, I can come with composite.  I love you. Dad. I love him instantly when I met him and like, I like to see, you know, anything about me. That's why I also like, really, really love you. Mom. Like I talk about conversations as like both of them. I'm not the man thoughts and minds and, and and everything in love in the right place. I just need my psyche.  S small area.  So, buying into the community of a fully-working from really work.  Single Arrow.  God damn, I'm sorry. That sounds tough made the right decision.  They're in the relationship better.  You'll meet them now, but a little Becky's.  I know, I think, I think it's just like, really hard to see what's going on in the mind of a teenager like that. And I'm not sure if I have truly really understood who he is, cuz, like, you don't really know. Okay, how it is. A sock of senses. Do we owe each other like very different circumstances, you know, very much and Times of like our experiences. So it's very much. They don't know how he's going to turn out and I think that's just like not the root of it. That's the root of my like, you know, the different environment. And it's a totally different person because of that. But those are somehow like he released him and I'm not sure like, what is emotions. I like, I'm not sure what kind of emotions he happens to it. She's angry that I left.  My older brother is as well.  so, it's like,  please, hurry. That's what connection at the very, like, Swedish silent. I think they hated, Sophia know. I'm pretty sure you didn't care about that kind of stuff.  I think it might be an asexual yet, like very much to type to beat everybody gave his life to sort of his walk.  I think he likes orange Yan ultimate like you about this because she's been around for a very long time. And like ultimately, I think what they want, my family has about a seriousness, you know, like how like realize you and, you know, like how serious are you. And I think they know I'm not just like fucking around.  You know, this isn't like, I'm bringing someone like foreign into the house. Like this is like someone. This is like the someone  Yeah, what time is it is a very weird pressure in my head different kind of Impressions. It's like, it's like I feel in my in the house. In Scottsdale is not my house. I don't feel like, I don't feel like it's like, I've always really dislikes living that I've always felt alienated from the space. I feel like we're a family that's not that's like the house, our house like feels like Paul and you know, this place feels all exterior. It feels wrong.  Send for who we are. And I think you'll get that impression right away.  Because I like it doesn't look like our house at all. Like what would it be like our house is like the van now since we didn't, you know in the fucking house and told him. Yeah, very much like some of the Vibes in many ways.  Always always been moving alive, the completely split up around Long, sentimental value to watch this house in Scottsdale. So be interesting to see, totally  There's also have like weird to have like four people like us about him.  Variable.  One variable can totally like dominate the equipment. You'll probably a relationship with your brother. Sometimes is like, the one of the main things that drive the truth, or  Undeniably accurate, and the thing I realize that it's not, it's not the Triumph of reason, but it's like you cannot separate who you are from The Angry Angry knots, moral relativism with that and when does Katniss get to it?

0,"You have to call her in a walking a just left out.  And call them when drinking beers doing homework.  You will see something cool off of sunshine. Is a whole text history from 16 on 100. How are you doing? In asking me how hot the sun is rising up from all the lost I was doing. This is just one of those one of their response inside of gave it to the question, but I still got my phone. I would have walked really exhausted and me to go I can go right away. I can sweep you from your feet and Magic masquerade. This is awesome. When I was 16, you know, what tax form like back then and be you what it what could I steal your persona Pops in a dream Pops in A Midsummer's Night Dream. This is about about this about whether I can still have the soda pops that can like this can happen in a dream pops up on A Midsummer's Night. Dream Pops in the summer yet to come with the haases at rest wrapped in White Satin moments quotes in a waltz. I don't know what that means.  Garland city, so Serene pops went in the subway, train stops in the dark alley, in the strange town in the saving wild, all these references to pieces of my history. By the way. I'm pops was in this parking, lots of Times Square. A pops of a concert when hearing my favorite song, pops is in the forest orgasm with a lover in the springtime, passed in the negatives, perhaps in the negatives and positives, Hopsin Ill, Mind Hopsin, a dream, papson Avail, perhaps in your wake, where I dress like a purple butterfly passenger room hops in the sphere Pops in the spaces between the Stars passed Rising once more from the bottle, in the wall pops and ride zone is perhaps in the poem passed in the basic fucking French guitar song. We love the hat and a savannah, chopped is pops and train rides, and walks, Hogs hikes sleepless, nights and bleary eyes stops in moments of anxiety, Pops in the beauty of the Spire, the infinites, perhaps, in the conversation.  Music and writing and beauty and love and hate and hate and love and hate and love once more. I have some hot pops of Bill in the Silence of the night. In the fuel transients, about human nature of his to go. Coexistence will approach God. Deep in the hyperborean pops. It is a fantasy beyond the tangible, but perhaps it is here in my house.  And that's like this generated by the computer and you know it like that it just please like these total just so there's like a proximation. So yeah, it's insane is insane fucking settings.  It's getting old looking deeper into what hyperborea was that? We were probably talking about that. Anyway.  That's a.  Yeah, I bet I wouldn't even swim the things by no.  If I tried to down probably but like when you can do it, just incredibly difficult.  So it's like I've convinced myself. I'm never going to try to land in line which went while not living there again.  I wish I I just feel like you don't have Archie lawn it unless you actually like that cuz I think I think somehow like Wyatt. It's really cool that she's helping me with this much.  Not the English teacher. Now that the high school English teacher Vibe. She has a little bit of that in the best way possible.  Really?  Yeah, I got.  Cool.  I'm leaving. I'm sorry.  I'm sorry, the breeze, overhead.  Facilities.  My thing is about to die.  Jesus Christ is Arbiter.  I think.  I think I'm almost all of it switches, you know, like that, you know, if like someone is like a really abusive boyfriend or something like that or like something someone had a really bad relationship and something was really terrible. And then one of the people break up over text because I might be like, scatter passing might be like, whatever, whatever, and the other person doesn't think about anything that they did wrong, but that instantly Justified because oh, they broke up of a text. That's all that matters to me. You know, I mean, it's almost the same thing. I think the only thing that thinking about is the actual distance between the fact that when she broke up and when you guys got together and I think that is, the only thing people are looking at it, instead of thinking about anything else that only thinking about that and stop being like, you know, it's sort of like you broke up with taxable. No, no. No. I'm saying that it's the same thing as as that in, which is like gas. It's technically a bad thing to do, but like you're guessing like  Chocolate.  They're still in a relationship.  again, it's okay to like maybe assume something like  How did he find out?  I do understand like like why it like is like hot full.

And I mean, in Russia, with my back to the sea was a song. They need to call learned this message to bill you for anything the entire area.  Pencil method to make Swedish military base, as well as hell. That's constantly Russian submarines. I having constantly sort of like a military thing. He has been for the Bostitch 20 years has been like military drills.  Overstock.com.  And over this island and all over the place until like they have a plan for making Sweden.  And it's sort of like we had to sort of think about that.  Family.  It's one of those things while I got his precious. Psychic thinking more like substantial way.  Next weekend is over felt like on the list.  But like right then.  Neutral.  I think they would be there as soon as I can sense of like.  The problem is if they try to take a neutral country.  and,  they trying to take the whole country, like, Thailand in the Baltic that Sweden owns all the luck by the foot because I'm extremely  I was just crazy because it's like, you know, Sweden was always like, right next. You as a saint. I can throw this whole thing straight right on the boy. That sounds like it's always been like a hurricane.  Ancestry.  Take me to country style, so stressful.  that sounds like too stressful, but it's like a  cuz like my sort of, in line with the Eastern Europeans in,  But not seriously, you're going into the flag.

0,"That's going to be angry at my group. But what are you going to?  Well, I just walked all day on the plantation as well.  Went to dinner with Neiman fine. Extremely boring. Is she psychic voted away old pots of like his  I know she could like.  I know by living pool in this extremely sensitive and case weigh in one side of the Stevens do dreaming. It's just now.  Yeah, I know. So I can understand helps that he rolled and what he feels like rather than of now, so I feel rather than him being a develop 21 year old.  Absolute mean.  Tabula rasa.  In.  Nicole Lester.  I didn't show up.  Yo, what's good?  I yeah, I don't know if we actually got an approval. I mean, I don't know if we go out there a dinosaur named Satchel actual like you can go ahead on. Okay. I want to three bug, free book for my classes. I was sick. Okay, I'll come I'll come down now.  Got to walk on your shed until the IV. I'm not sure if we're ready quite yet. I think could be useful to use free by 4 and go like me to. Should we meet in like 30 minutes or something?  Yeah, I've been working on it for a while. We're going to need to fix. All of that are smiling and set the code book, has to be button.  I will change the change the rest to, but so the code book has to get, has to be put in the small. Each of you needs to be fixed. They want to do things with that, figure out. So, the key we have stuff to do the key takeaways and then  Well, yes.  I kept in the thing is we need we need Daniel. So give him a call, get him over, get him over here.  Yeah, I'm in the library. So. I just woke up.  Smoke break right now or walking over doing work over with me a cigarette. I am. I can't you.  Should I say bad words?  Okay.  I'm assuming a 30-minute thing. It won't be with while you finish that will smoke off day today.  Yo, what's up? I've been working on this house for a while. So the date is summary and the code book. I'm just going to get walking if you guys can fix this mod a look at it. Yeah. Okay. Dragon from the graphics to yeah. Yeah, just you just grab the icons. We don't need those icons off. And also if you could make the tax all the same and  And then, if you could do the, yeah, I know what, I haven't done those. I am. So, if you could, I changed a few of our goals cuz I think it's really easy. Needs to be added is the generate top three suggestions things at a time. If you can manage to fit in without making it any bigger, if you can fit in the Jen, I didn't take Winnie to in cut, that generate top three today floss face.  The only, the only problem with that is that the arrow looks really weird next to the equal sign it. And not just. Yeah, it's out of. It. Looks like the comparison is the same thing. I'm possibly already talked about that into two slides down, but I do think the contacts light is lacking wondering what we can do to make it better and go over. These really want to stay home.  You guys time with this a how to set up that, I like the way you went to change them around. Do you guys find with this setup?  Give a Disney plus is all of these things are like a part of Disney plaster, not all of them. But if we have Disney Plus.  Subsidiaries Sofia.  I think it looks good as as though, technology if you can walk in the contacts, I doubt any fantastic to somehow like the titles for the MVP in the post Mbps on my lackluster, actual like heading. Yeah, I wonder what we can do because it doesn't benefit. You think I'll make it a different phone. I'm not shown in the Bible product instead.  Population studies, in more Central, I put it into a MVP because honestly that's not something that we have to do. That's like what I found before it's going to be for the timeline.  I'm going to see Malik the single protective system.  I want to see if maybe just leave it. We can just leave out the generator. Key features that the three thing we can just leave it out on the sea. I don't think it's a problem. I don't think we need to put it in. You going to do the key, takeaway. Saurabh that be great, and then look pretty pretty much.  I'm going to walk in the club book now.  I don't know. She putting that take away from the project. I think we're talking about like this is takeaways from the presentation. Just this presentation to take away is alike from this presentation. Is it the gold dust of the solution increasing Global presence is required at requires, Alaska.  Increasing Global something like that.  Well, it's actually technically, all I wanted Mike just said when that we don't have to explain anything, but pretty much just saying, like, Disney Disney streaming is massive and encompasses, so many different brands, so many different, and so many, so many different, like somebody different shows.  Like. That is pretty much. Where is pretty much what we're saying? And it's getting composite in the room that you probably say. Like there are many things here that like you might recognize, you know, that whole mad Marvel franchise Star Wars pics of all of Disney, the Disney stuff that I know, of course, all of the Disney stuff that you already know and love type thing. I think the point is just a sort of like describe how a multi-faceted sure if it is too. I'm not sure if we have to do what we could also do if you want to do this is that you can do a little pockets.  System wiha psbn bucket like that. Sue little bucket like that. They sniff lost a little bucket like that and then stop it. Like it's hot. Like incorporate star into this delete stuff.  We can fit that in some way. That would be great. I'm not sure why, but do we want it to be super ordered like that, but we just kind of went nuts because I think he would have to be tight if we if I try to squeeze it.  Omega.  Show me make that Saints. And now I'm going to I'm going to throw in the Cold Creek right now.  Disney plus has a total of like seven animes like in total like that summation. By any means, we shouldn't stress it too much. But like, as an example. Yes, I think more  I have some of your psyche. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's I think that's good. I think one important facet is is multilingual household as well. Like if you have a profile for instance, like I speak several languages, my with my family and yeah, it doesn't, you know, like I don't got the opportunity to watching all the different thing. I like it doesn't like switch base instead of like with Messy as soon as which English now, I mean, which sucks. I could book him to cut big ass. Anyway to make a border around the text box so that we could sign.  Popeyes me make that textbooks like Peter. So that it's a key features when switching over the smart off on the other one as well. And the data overview and went batshit to break, I either to copy and paste so really quick. I'm just going to move you and you slide up.  Cuz I was want to make these icons much bigger and have a bit more control over the text.  Like, I'm going to be a little table.  Can we do like that?  You can just copy over the tax, spoke to me and others. Can I do the little bike table?  Eyelashes.  Disney.  Presents.  What just happened?  Who is that?  But you don't mind having the black background at the beginning. I think if we just do focus and do a really good job, everyone else. He'll be fine with all of the black background on this day.  Yeah, I just got to keep it back. The funds in the 14.  And we should listen to him about the idiot. Was at the house about to do blue black and white get rid of.  I can do that. I'm just. Do you think you can do this? Yeah, I actually could use some of that feature. I just want to figure out what the best day of the best features to include.  That's right.  Can you search for that?  Yeah, I was just technology.  Yeah, I did not seem much better. Overall. Rest all the risk is it was really vague and kind of weird and if you like, it was Buck questions and ultimately that wasn't right. That isn't really a risk that we have to think about. Anyway, the bigger much bigger risk than that, is the size of the data and I will walk. I walk it out there for like, 3 hours today and it was just really difficult and I can't even imagine what it's going to be like the training module on this, so we can have to talk when that computer resources.  Which one of them is important? I thinking we can do little like,  yeah, I think we should do.  Why do some title and subtitle?  Ashley, let me stay.  I'm not sure if I, we need that much detail. Yeah, so, a single account. I just the same thing you wrote above.  Like like this probably but yeah. And that  Going to do, this will just do two pages for the code books.  Countdown country.  Oh wait. I haven't finished it yet for the second ID G type.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7.  So 15.  What's 9?  SEC SS. All the same. So  so for the psychographic, these ones will do predicted that many segments of it s of accounts and then we'll do like the examples.  Addicted.  Aftertaste.  That's a taste one that you're typing on.  Oh, I will see you Tuesday.  and then we do we add ins, I'll add in the  Household has young kids EG.  It'll make the sound smaller.  So your graphics Aikman Chase Bank, please display segments accounts.  Notice to EG and example and then we should be good. I just need to make this old small.  Hopkins, 10.  Can you figure out how to, like make these the same size? So, make all of these size 10? Cuz this one is says that its size 10, but I still have to do everything to make them all size 10.  Seriously.  Poppin Poppin, regular not medium.  I don't do this in a ticket so I can find.  No, I can add the first so we can have a size 12 foot popping on that side and then sized. It, just not really very important. So I don't want to like draw too much attention to it.  Maybe we can make bold to the side.  Yeah, sure. It just needs to be telling the other side's for the for the things to fit.  Simpson at work, just the age, no hole. If you're right about that. I think I just  What's up? I can't it seems like where we shouldn't really walk on.  Natural presentation.  Lisa.  Starting from 1 to 4. And the reason is because I do anime thing. I feel like who is much better this stuff. She talked about them.  Saurabh, do you mind doing a timeline risks? And then the key takeaways? Okay, just need for Global. Do you mind if we it's kind of like hard to like a slightly hard to read because of the problem overview on the lot of tax time because the black and white epic. It's like, kind of tough to Disney is the key. Takeaways. Yeah. I think I think we need to cut. We need to cut it. Download like a sentence.  Or maybe like a bullet. Well, maybe we can do like, can we do like stop bullets or something like that? Is that possible? Just make it like really well, like, like we have a problem with you and then we have bullets, like 23, like 23 like really broadening Global presence.  You know what? I mean, and then we caught those Downs, like the short look like.  Broadening Global presents and language. And it's a  Diverse audience.  Listening diverse audience.  Contents.  Awesome presents used to 7.  Current naive.  Naively.  Yeah, what's a good way to put that?  She likes the gold on post.  Battle.  Current sub table settings.  Think.  Oh, I got to ignore at current Subs.  You can also do at the combine, the other things, current sub table settings.  particular like ain't no needs of  Ignore, ignore needs a man.  Maybe impossible.  Okay.  Maybe we can make this a little bigger.  Yeah.  I do not want to see the ad still sits at the bolus of the wrong color.  Do not make the white bullets.  It's a lot of people.  It's a slightly different because I think it's these. No, I want to put on want to do like on the state. We can just do this.  And then we can copy of a proposed solution and then we just didn't. Wait. Let me just fix this.  Some reason this changed phones 2 aerial. Some reason Poppins.  An addictive, you want to figure out exactly what we're going to say, on each side in like points pretty much. Or do you want to do you want to meet? Do you guys want to meet like for 30 minutes before that? So presentation and give it? I think we should practice once but it was cuz I got a grade is pretty much just a dumb and buy this and then I'll final  and now she's going to get scrap for one day. I'll get a chance to write a script and go up to talk 15 minutes.  So like, they just write allocate like I got your other thing is is that like we need to, I just want to, I want to make sure that we were on the same page. Just left each of us, don't write the scripts, complex, with each other. So I can like, fix this lost key. Takeaway off to us. Let's run through it.  So you and I are we going to introduce us house fast.  Yeah, that people did that. But we also want to like we basically threw away with the conventional like Idols, because like we could also just on, I don't think Mike's going to come ashore. You're right about that.  So fast lie, we introduce our names.  Doing it. Do you guys want to take note? So we can like can we have like a common do Google. Call? We walk on the  Google doc with like slide numbers, I mean, say then directly before this.  Customer, I do. When's the end. What about 12?  Send picture to a 15, that's why I'm at 1:15. But like I feel like we have like a little before. I could we could just do it right before. Like it's it's usually a Time. The thing that comfortable with that thing that you want to say. So the last for like the last minute, but whatever. You see a last-minute, anything can happen, you know? Everything we know what we have to say, but, you know, you start before meeting text a minute before the time. I think that would be much better than just, what are you suggesting meeting? So, we have at least some practice before class where we practice before and coming in here.  What's up? Why don't you wish we need to do one set to just walk in time at at least?  Or so everyone feel free to comment on each other scraps sit down and correct them because if we come here at the correct, I think that like what the best thing to do is to if we can meet once tomorrow at like 12 or something like that cuz you have a cough right afterwards. I don't want to be like stressing, right outside here, trying to, like, run through a presentation really quickly. That's just going to be, like, not pleasant in the slightest. I think we should, we should meet at like 12:15 12:20, 12:25 and if possible, and we'll meet for 15 minutes, 20 minutes run through the presentation. One through the presentation with the slides on the computer. We can fucking do it, where I'm at, and we just fucking, we time it and we just go through it and we can give each other really quick notes.  And that's enough time between like that. And what I was at least, think about it before that presentation. I didn't got it.  Compare attic my part. I often see things that you apart, is going to take it. Take some time so that we can just allocate. I only think this is going to be pretty even allocation. I think we should spend the most time on this knee on slide 6, 7 8.  And 9 are those in most important slides and Nate. I think it's a bit. It's a lot of those are a lot of insides and you can, I'm just wondering if I can because these the data summary and the the the to the data summary thing is good.  Very quick, honestly, I can do that. Okay, awesome. I'll do nine 10, 11, 12 13, ask LL, fly Wild n Out because 678 a really important and for that one that went through it. I think we should need to have like, okay, let's imagine you sit down. You know, I have like a couple hypotheticals, you know.  The same might be like, you know, imagine that you imagine like an Anime Watcher who has really strong preferences for what sound devices, David, you know it. Imagine a multilingual household evidence of like myself and like how a pension and profile setting would be an English-speaking person from the United States. Still have these sort of implicit preferences, right? For the perfect. That's that's exactly that that's that's that. Before you can do yourself a language line, is it gives him a small example for multi, You Know, The Enemy and multilingual. I think went in the second Point, by the way, no suggested language has become such abuses documents, right? It's it's like it's needed to say that like if everything is all like mixed up. It's not like organized by like most common even, you know, all I can most likely. So if you  Set towards the specific language input that change settings. Go see manual shift. Today. It's not safe. I move into. If I, if I start a show and then click on Jammin cuz I want to watch the show and jamming, then like the playback language is Jah, man, even if I click on the different job again, something about I think I'm pretty sure that. That's what that's what they say. Like, you see, you have to go back in like manually switch these things. When you click on the new piece of content, right?  That's weird. Jasmine that can be made within like a particularly, like a particular shows. Like environment rice, what? I think. Yes, so because if you wanting a bunch of shows together, you wouldn't you want to do that, but I'm not, I'm not sure how true it is. Yeah. I'm talking about announcing the years experience. I think that's perfect.  What time you saw. This is so like it, make it a approximately like 3 minutes each for 34 minutes. Each.  You can't you can do yours, like instinct season one or two of those things that we wrote in the statement of walk that like the Disney is like it's like located and you know, it's like a really big company. What happened? You got it this with us that we can stop typing on this document.  So we can like I don't know. Little Scripps. Why would you guys be 12:25 something?  I awesome. I think we got like there's like one last bullet to change at the end in the key. Takeaways, but I can't I just got really fucking worried by Mike's response on the sea.  Yeah, well, we also it will send that. I just want to make a sweater a nice one.  Yeah, I mean, he's only a pretty soft-spoken guy. You know, he's like a very nice guy, like that might come me to. Yeah. I know if you could just type of scripts in there. Yeah. I'll see you guys.  Right.  Poop.  Really?  Episodes. Halfway on this time. I must have like, freaking out.  I'm just too busy.  I'm connection.  Assign.  Taking side.  Itsfunneh.  Why is that so low?  Timeline risk. Question, is this?  No.  I don't know why people think something is different company.  To giving you off to you. This is necessary. Then you trying to say this is not to Disney. What's going on?  You know, we know what's going on. Is that idea?  Very pretty.  I'm here. Let me see if I can make this a little bit more.  Yeah, I do. I will.  Not going to be out like or I went to dinner.  Scott's I didn't text him meeting you.  Made.  Takeaways.

But I think I think ultimately like you have to be okay with like allowing like four of your kids to die and have three of them survive.  Which is that we have to steer, says plan member. Yeah, I agree with that.  example of  Oh my God, yeah.  That's the crazy thing is that that's the nature of your adjusting itself as well. Like one of the most insane arguments that I had recently, was. This argument was the argument that like, so that the humans are also in this cycle of, you know, like if a lot of wolves died in 01 winter, you know, then what happens to the food resources and stuff like that and defeat all the other resources, like the end up dying, because there's not enough resources.  so, the humans rules are just  Yeah, that's the address for saying nature. Like, even to self out again and kill off a bunch, that's open.  Yeah.  Yeah, I agree with that.  Cuz I replaced them with my friends and then I promise after promise Community, which is like lost.

Lines of thought.  We should have at least replace a loan for this kind of cross.  Near there.  Oh, yeah, we can do that. Even if we don't have a house, but we'll probably get a house somewhere.  The almighty God.  Like the two distinct argument, right? One is an argument of like, oh there was this impending Tyler and everything like that, you know. And that like off and nature is like the even if he wants or likes to stay in the current population that we watch that we have. What will end up happening is that will like the current population is unstable. What decrease the population of culture is like a mass interference in a large-scale wiping out by A diversity at a fast rate, right? So if you have it, if you want to cut out the agriculture, you just have the mess. Anyway.  You don't go about actively killing towards this principle. He does. But the quite the question is like there are a lot of really dubious ethics in there as well. Of course, it's dubious by human standards.  Like that was then you just get the new. You got like a global aristocratic order of some sorts and everyone else with that certain people should die. The only people who will survive and not our people have to quit the real question then though is that like if you cause off Mass agriculture then essentially, yes, it's it's that is that is directly kill it.  Like most communities Wine Liquor shot in Iraq, Cohiba Cuban Community or like his ass. Instead of like that was that was always a power than a mechanic community.  Then you will have to be okay with okay. With everyone else is also supposed to like that cuz I was just walking through this in my own mind. You come by at least a major.  Yeah, but you can, humans are naturally. Two species. Just put yourself in that environment and you don't think that's like so true. I totally see that. But I  That is a witch way that we looks kind of fun.  What I mean, EverStart, there were several things that right. Is that, okay? How are you to swear that with you all day? Like when she then also be  The thing is is that that itself is an ethical or moral sort of like opinion that in order to walk would have to spread through globalism.  Right in in, in, in, in, in in, and out way, right now. And that would be a disaster. Like the contradiction of like okay, if you're okay with like  Locally the time in it rather than the full population like that. Then you also have to be okay with, you know, leaving mentally ill kids or whatever anything like the forest to die or be eaten by the Wolves, you know, that's part of that.  Like yeah, they leave the kid.  Cynthia. But elephants are the ones that are similar similar to us in this afternoon sense of my family and like 40 consideration, like in the, in the in in Bud, in Bud, in bud.  I'm not saying that they don't, I don't have no morality. I'm just I'm saying that like the social functioning of humans come out in many different ways, right?  I'm not saying sociality hundred percent, but I'm saying that like in the back to that local level, you know, the local image should have one is one instead of, you know, have to walk, you know, 86 x 28 hours a day. So I have like collecting food, you know, living. Sort of like Gathering.  So, if not Farms, then what?  An anarchic, if you don't have funds, then what?  So, what would you do? Would you cut them away?  Families of subsistence Farms. Yeah, I forgot his enormous amounts of of Salvation and then Cycles.  Order trying to look like manually increased population.  Poor poor creature more vacations again. Yeah, because it was so awesome. Fish Ali, propped up populations with with these my phones.  Been happening for thousands of years, tragedy of the commons as well.  Tell the Great Depression. Depression was famine, came diamonds diamonds, a diamond. That's like the most natural thing in the station.  Tax collection rights to the British indigenous leaders.  Okay.  I'm going to stop by for one time and were happening, but people could recognize it because it like natural, like what made the crops Could Happen whether to make it bad. So, people leaders had set it up. Like they said, they don't really care about the citizen. So there was no stockpiling for the harder time because he didn't care about the local population who have been arming, you know, like like like for-profit corporate structures. You don't, then I said, to the death goes from being like to buy you a Coke, buy buy that buy that buy the other argument of the eagle, whatever, that would be a good thing.  Avoided and I'm told but why would you want to avoid that Central and not having a lot of these phones. Now, that we have the status quo of that, you'd end up calling. My family knew about the end of the day. I'm saying, now I'm thinking that if he wants to decide to take away, current centralized agricultural system, has generated by those centralized Farms diamonds Auction. Zip auctions. Isn't like, what that, that's what that's like, you know, when I logged as a maid and then after the natural environment doesn't supply enough food and then it kills off a loss of the damn. That's a famine.  Maybe set up the structures when that should just be a different kind of farming, except more people would be walking on time. Just be a different kind of like 10:00 both Global found me for people to like Farm in again, when that just to Scarsdale.  Oh, yeah, it's totally at most places are not disconnected from reality like that because we weave weave weave made the system, quite a more efficient, is the deposits in the middle. Watch out for like snakes and spiders and stuff. So funny, you want to live like  Oh, yeah.. Like that. Like protective layer cuz it doesn't cover the whole thing. It's like it's probably a sex act with something. That's what it's like to text you. From the song that grows out, leaks out somehow. It's unbelievable on the natural engineering. There must be some I might be some like wait like used be inspired by that still sort of like cuts of server do rather than using a condition that like covering how this with that kind of  The most, yeah.  It's an ant it's naturally regulating like if you stopping to it through the forests or something. It's super cool. It's really cool. I like at this is why I like file like biology and shit like that is really cool. Cuz I feel like if I was like a biologist right now and like a designer as well. I did go in like take a little bit of a sample of that thing. You're not studying figure out what it is and see if we can create that same material, you know, that is sort of like natural in this way like a little laboratory and like I would like to look at look through it. I love the face scrub.  Thank God, you're beautiful. Watch out for the other creatures living here.  If I saw something like big.  Yeah, to the hole in the ground.  Write down in that lives in like some dude.  Getting inspired by that velocity like this white boxes.  Find me Nate. But even I guess like, the one thing that like. I like Ethan coming to mind for me, like an inn. In the argument against it. Is that like, how do we know that we will last measurable before? Like, how do we know that? It isn't letting like a hobbesian, you know, it states of just like of a paint.  I just feel like we have to like what we will hold it while holding so many.  Oh, no, that people inherently bad. I mean that the state of the human. I mean that the state of human life is is is  What? I don't know how  Comparative. You want to walk around like that. It was fine. I don't know how like comparatively miserable like it's kind of like a I don't like Aunt. Like say anything about the previous about if you would life was last measurable before.  Turn out in America. And yeah.  But let's say, yeah, it was routed, interesting thoughts. I love these guys, this, listen to this, like this. So cute.  You look very beautiful. I told I told you, I like, I completely agree. But in order to get that, we're going to have to, like my question is not like things that the truth is somewhere. I like it. The truth that we can get people to settle that will get people to change, isn't like, an isn't is an integrated with our current and all that. We've learned in the past, like four hundred years. It can be integrated, you know, where that with us and princes? We can have like, like the power of technology. Is unbelievable. Right? Like one. Can you use technology anyways until like Foster environmental growth? No.  yeah, but at the same time you don't like like  make water.  But no, they got the material and loves make diamonds with carbon. And the cop in that we got is also from cold. So that's also mind. I think that that's another positive side of the nature that we we can that we can use part of the problem with mining is, is the process of cleaning. Its on the chemicals used are in, is not answer the process of extracting stuff. Extracting stuff from there like that. Like. That's March Apophis would have liked the geological structure of things and then I'll just I mean like I and exist in all societies almost, you know, even like like like in digital indigenous tribes. Also, how does that in front of my name?  Hundred percent, but at the same time, like, if there was a lot of extraneous like stuff on the use, that was cast out through the extraction of these materials. For instance, like all like, those massive like offices like file cabinets, like also opt for the enormous amount of paper, the enormous amount of like I like stuff that was needed in the hot. Like like there's that there's an eco.  The destruction is a necessary condition of how we how can we? How can we change the way we live in order to destroy last? And I don't believe that's what I'm saying.  At this at the book it. But at the same time it's like, you know, that day on my birthday when we did like Trails Terry Wright. You hated that. You like. Hay. But I was like an actual like cats at 2.  like no, I'm just  yeah, I guess, I guess, I guess like, I guess there was a staffing level of like it, that like  We have to figure out a way to know I was coming fast. I want to like live that I want to figure out a way to change my life fast and figure out that way before I necessarily before. Because I think I think like a lot of people will take whatever one says, and immediately just like hook it back. I was just looking at them. Beautiful. I definitely believe in what I'm just saying that like it, if we going to do something that like we, there's there's definitely a way to sort of like preserve and tons of like getting out taking out the idealism and looking straight at like how we actually can we implement this and do it Chase bleed in sort of the thing about. Okay, people can give up like a little bit of comfort but people aren't going to go live like that, you know, know know I know but I'm a traumatic it was a domestic thing, right? And nothing. Tons of like so like it, there are ways in which we can sort of like  Continues her like to integrate this into Sunday. At the same time. It's like framing. This is like I think positive framing is one of. You know, we have to go back and  Yeah, that's really cool. And I think I think that like I think I think that I'm not even like talking about your your your your your you are doing right now. First thing. I feel like I should be on. I feel like technology has an enormous, a power to be able to sort of like create abundant without necessarily deprecating.  Physical quantities as much cuz like one single little instrument Robin, having like all like a, a calculator thing, whatever this and this and this and this and this and this and all of these massive amounts of things. We can just have a single thing that can can do all of these different services. Like these things that would wasn't that forget the environment and condense it into a single little thing that like like from somehow like, I was this way exit.  And for me. Like, really cuz like somehow like a like one of the  We have that we can use technology in order to Bassett integrates of ourselves into environment. For instance. The fact that we can't build in BIOS files extraction. You know, that might be like really good cuz it's like 15 to complicate this route.  I'm not saying that you are. I'm trying to throw in the extra set of like facet of all that like it. There is a soft like throwing an extra thing. On top of that. I'm not arguing that you're famous.  but like for me, what's really interesting is that like I like all of these different like pods and passons fully know that enable us to sort of like a sort of a new history like a new way of a new mode of interaction, you know, that name of that those like possibilities are really interesting to think about because  Unlike like the walls needs like new new ideas. Being already means just as much as we need old ones.  But if we are to like Chase these things within our car, I think we also need a taste of what progress has.  Like blanket.  Appreciating, the flocks and constant, renegotiation of terms of thing that itself, just take the derivative of that, but not is, that's what it is right to as entry, attuning with the South and hominy isn't and golden of itself.  Christian, do things out of the way. I'm going to have natural abs and flows constant or famine, right? Like, the way I was work.  It'll never be a past tense. No, I'm saying I'm saying that that guessing to a back into an even flux, right? I guess, I guess I left, I definitely see what you're saying. I'm just saying that like  What am I saying? I think I'm just  sorry for being defensive, of course, and, and  Oh, 100%. I'm just, I'm just totally throw pieces in that will enable sort of like like in my mind in this Collective Collective Soul, live like this because whatever whenever you build a frame like I was supposed to company over and watch, you know, I'm not like that. That's what like this communication is about as opposed to like adjusting. So, how can we help you? Help one another beat. That's a people.  You know how?  But at the same time, like a Time Time analogy is a, it's it's it's is a collectively negotiating thing. It's sort of like using using a time thing. The bad, what, you know, when a lot of people other people think it's a good one, right? If I cannot necessarily sort of like, allowing the communication to happen on the wad. So they've been that once.  Yes, there is lots of it.  People feels like progress. If they'll like it, you know, the fact that you can get a can you get? Like I can get, I can get a wrist Back Robin. Having hot like be prominently, distorted like that.  Right. And to not being being like a handicap for the rest of my life and that was because of like medical technology and that was like considered like all this is progress right on that. The idea of progress, also, sort of like crazy that possibility, you know, the same idea of progress also created the possum.  Play test about Medicaid, tell hundreds of that so that we can save a few.  Find in German Goods.  Yes, but you can't say that you don't have to carry the same carry the same sense of what progress you saying that you don't like progress was different than what you said before then that is a fatty acid. That is a blanket blanket, bad thing.  Progress as a concept is about to what? I know. I'm saying that like that, like, instead of claiming it like that, like negotiated with me and stuff.  I'm saying that you have to like like you want some not frame it.  I don't, I don't, I don't like that like to watch progress either.  Nobody in some in some way, like I also. But I just got I don't like the word progress, doesn't mean that it. I don't I don't I think that it's  Would you want to see it? I think it's like I want to. Yeah.  Beautiful.  I love these things. We submitted these with sand in the water.  I'll look at the sky. Hello, Miss. Why?  Wow, those are beautiful and gorgeous. Oh my God, they have these little things that are sticking out like a lobster.  All Tigre PET test.  I guess I like the way you watching watching my mind. Is that like?  Reuse reuse and recycle type.  Like we used to reuse and recycle Wads for me is like a I really like I really like that because you can like rather than to live like leaving a dead body in the kitchen, of course, right now.  You know, but that but like that, of course. And I do. I do enjoy. I I I absolutely love the critique of the critique of progress. I'm just thinking about, like, I'm thinking on to the next steps about, like, like how do you like how does one set of like situate the ends of the wad, you notes to have progress, shoot towards the end as a wide is as well as as a society. We shoot two words that and for that to happen, we have to read identify the apple and the progress, right? Because I can societies moving on this afternoon, like Narrative of itself of progress, you know, and to walk back now would be for a loss of States. A lot of people off of everything to admit defeat. Do you know what I mean? Not thing is like very, very, very difficult and I think that one can admit  Hey, I'm going to be.  I am patronizing about about about about the difference between the Raptor back in the actual and the end, the end the set of like it that set of I'm just confident with a lot of things.  Of course I can.  What are my bestie?  We have to accept him into your life.  That's true. But like would you except a little bugs inside your home where you're living and sleeping? I know you hate that.  That's really, they become like Memphis. You like Hello? Mrs. By this. Why is that was actually longer.  Meet you both. I would love time.  I want I want like a wedding to be.  Like a fallen nature Twilight wedding.  Yeah.  A honeymoon trip. Yeah, definitely. And I'm really excited to like it. I think that like,  Now the question. Now the question is like how do we think? I'm not like that was a really, really sort of like  Like one of the most fascinating things is not like we can now get to understand plants a bit more rather than having a like flat should have like, no nuanced understanding. So  Oh, oh, I totally am. You can see that based on the fact that like old like an oil old SOG. I mean, like a plant, like plants and flowers are like everything, you know, yeah, they're like that everyone.  Yeah, I know they didn't. Oh, yeah. That was that. That's the most. That's the most crazy crazy things. Yeah, but the  I love apps that I absolutely love these ones.  I love that.  Those yellow flowers.  I guess that's what, like, what I'm really excited. But I absolutely love about the official intelligence is not liking. You can understand things that a totally different level, you know, and you not see Itachi through a lot of sort of science that we began to sell. Also said it would be better and deep understanding that we began to sort of like at the signals like oh shit, you know, he's totally doing this wrong and like continuing on this path.  How do you bring back endangered species, you know but through through so the better understanding. So that's like such an empathy like imagine that if we spend just as much time if not more. So appealing way sort of like how to understand that these guys don't even do about it.  Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I'm types of thing is is that we might be able to communicate with treason in a different way, you know, if we if we actually now that we understand this phone, go passing. I want to like hear The Mamas, you know, I just want to listen to the  Like, I think somehow there's something about the book and like, books and stuff, and, like, an awning. Like these people who have spent their lives, just communicating with something. And it was about to understand it, deeply understand it. You know, like it. Like I'm not look like it. The writings and that the Arts and that like something that I really want to do is to live this in this world coming back to my previous. I like part of the reason why I like really really want like a house in like a space or like a whatever or like or like a natural environment, like avellino has his natural environments and that way is so that I can stop losing myself in the territory and really understanding of place to set up an unbelievable extent and it's like doing a lot a lot of it, but at the same time that goes directly against another one of my values ideas of myself, you know, and it's a contradiction. I'm going to have to walk out at one point or nothing.  That was the other contradiction is own own learning. Everything I can do. I think there is enough everything to land in any given place. Right? But it's more. That like, my idea of myself as a global like as a global individual wanting to go to Berlin, you know, I'm doing that. Someone think the traveling to you. No exploring Math instead of wanting to see the walls and travel. And you know what I live in the city, you know, like that idea of myself. So if I really want to hold this ideology, I feel like I want to stop manifesting. It's someone I really like especially amongst these guys.  I love this one. Looks like I  From this angle looks like a to Thornapple elephant, dog.  Do you know what I mean? That's a conversation. I'd love to figure out.  these are no longer just so  Switzerland.  Singapore.  SoCal.  Yeah, exactly. It's it's it's on the thing is like, really but like in in times of the integration and Times of an imagine in new ways to live which is why I like I've been design of the ship that you're doing right now is like so fucking cool. Writing is the fact that that is also a similar way of like integrating should have been you with the old because the only way to live sustainably with the environment isn't the hot like suburbs nowadays, you know, there was a way to live sustainably of the environment in which you convince everyone, to a singular place, you know, and have sort of like the least intrusive presents on the loft of a sort of the natural environment, you know, so that you can have like a massive fart. Imagine all of New York being just a massive forest, and then you just had a massive super metropolis and that was like, integrated with it with you.  They look like sea creatures.  Bees.  What?  Is this what baby Joshua Tree? Now? I don't believe it.  Call delicious.  Disturbing the young time to rest, stop.  Oh, these are beautiful with the white flowers when they're blooming.  Like. So I feel like it's one of my, like, one of the biggest like possible Johnny's. Our goals is to sort of figure out a way to integrate my life with nature, as well, along with all of your along along with all the things to even try and lie. That's like one of the main I want to like try so many different ways and experiment and figure out some how to lift and live and be a cat. Take a filet. Try the, how does, how do we do that? Now? We have like a whole motivation for it. Now. We need to figure out to do it.  How we going to do it in all Island?  but sweetheart, I know they like it pauses for look like  other than the odd piece.  Can we play, can you do a lot of your projects like on acid fast?  Like yeah.  You know what? You can also do? Like we can do it from.  Do you want it? We can go back next spring and do it together. I won't have school at that point.  Who sing. Cuz I can also like it if you come to like the initial, like planting and stuff like that. If it needs, like some cat taking for the, like 2 weeks or something off to is it, I can like stay and do those do a lot of things.  I don't like the way. My partisans gave me.  Handsome.  Yeah, I know, but English Gardens suck.  Hell, yeah, thank you calling is fantastic. That's the way, that's the way it should be on this lie.  Rounded. It becomes so outside. Oh, yeah. That is this one house across the lake. That my parents are really angry at they cut down, all of the trees in front of the house so they can have it for you. You know, how houses oldest trees in front of it. I think the bastard. Can you see these beautiful Pines as well as the other end like it. They're like so many things that like, I would love, I would love, love, love, love to like Justin so much. Then they was like, provide a lot of their own food through like hunting and different different. Other like fishing activities and stuff like that. You know, I know it's really cool.  And then it's on like five thousand acres of land.  Right now is dominated by Elaine and I think my parents did that, God, and others of that when they sell the house is going to be more valuable current conceptions. You know, that's the cool thing. Like I can't imagine a lot of the kids our age or like the kids in like an hour or like even. Yeah, I know exactly read. Like absolutely love that shit. That's the cool thing though. Is that you're going to be able to. You're going to you're going to go out for that willing audience, you know for your for your for your project. Really likes them. He really likes me.  No, he's not at all consistent. He has some really contradictory beliefs.  I do think that the libertarian is sort of the slightly more aggressive male version of like kind of like it somehow of of the Libertarians are like one of those like consensus groups that can be you know, that's why you got these like really cool setup like Eco. I've been calling. You have a lot of people with a lot of solar panels, you know, they live like they don't buy too much sand on consumerism, you know, and then they said if I like very much ecological and anyways  I don't, but the problem is, I signed given up on like ideas and ideology. He just wants to be comfortable.  I think he's interested. That's like that's like that the Achilles heel of Simoniz. He's like, extremely concerned with making money. No, to raise a family as I like most people.  I think everyone would like socks but his bike.  I'm almost to the trying to think through these questions cuz I'm like What's the trying to think? Okay, like what place do I have in all of this? And you're not just a nature, but also just instead of like wanting to have a  They bought stuff so fucking cool. Like I'm, I'm thinking I'm like, I'm not like my question. Is that like  Like, it's hard to stop that, you know.  It's like in Oshawa both ways. You know, it's hard to stop. You know what it is. Like is it is Assassin. Momentum. That is really difficult for the easiest possible routes is continuing forward. You know, I'm so like I'm wondering like, how do I take what I'm done. Now. Looking at like, you know,  The mind and myself instead of these artistic things cuz it's gorgeous.  Hello, Sariah.  Gone Fishin.  What time is it in 1247?  Do want to cut up that Asian panties at Fest.  Do you know what happened to the the cell, right then?  Oh, yeah, so let's give it a little wash.  To do it and we going to take it.  Honestly, honestly, I feel like I feel like a what flocking isn't you guys is like a fantastic like cleaning and design. Whatever. It's like, how do you actually build a mansion? It like a like a like a sustainable system, you know.  I just liked the smell pretty bad. You can wash them in the in the bathtub. I can do this yet.  Oh.  I didn't wash it all. I put it into that.  Dishwasher, is it so? Is that what smells so good?  I don't know about that.  Search.  Emily.  Have you had them yet?  When I have these in the fridge, they become even more like refreshing. It's like a little like him.  Like a cold.  Rasterbator.  It's origin is so nice.  Also absolutely love this table. That was it's like, suction needed like thing.  Now you want to have like a lot of surfaces that you can like put stuff on.  Pink.  Oh, that's a great take everything. So why do you just move the coffee table back in book? A check to all the students have the chastening then?  Jo sanjh, I kind of want to start out kind of wanted to join you join you a company.  the thing, like the thing is, is that like  I'm thinking of like a place where like I can.  Use.  Oldest get lost. I'm letting you know and I'm thinking not like it would be really cool. Like we could do like a really cool like  integrated set of like a like Eco, you know, extremely ecologically by using sort of like very assertive. Like, like one thing I was thinking with issue, right? Was it was crazy in that sort of like like a really details metrical measuring system. Such a people can keep track of that household and people can keep track of sort of like everything that's going on. So like what if you integrated that like with sort of an environment with whistles. So, so if I'm not going to be fabulous and recreates and somebody,  Yeah, and the thing was the cool thing is that like if you do that, if you do that's a redesign and all that stuff to make like a extremely whatever, you can sort of like get people in on, like I can get a bunch of developers in on and get a bunch of like whatever. And instead of like,  Creating extremely ecologically buildings vs. Zverev vs of the technology and then that this, whatever and then have people and then if that's connected to like an apple connect, it's like a thing that people can use of, like, look at their own lives and our own systems and the way in which the living you don't keep track of that stuff and friends. Since like half God is that like a water, you know, his stuff like that and have that be integrated with like the app so they can look look and be like, oh, let me click that and stop the watering now. Well, I mean  Water escape with that. Like I feel like people, we got really excited and really sort of interesting that especially like all these. Like, there are a lot of, like, a lot of people ultimate lie, you can peel a thing. Also, to like, a lot of fast to a lot of, like, it all to mately have to appeal to you as fast. Like, you appeal to some of these developers of these like wealthy. I like wanting to do good people, you know, in order that who get who actually have the money in the palace, like changed. I got a city on that scale.  Radical little picture Kid.  Nutrients, do a lot of nutrients really moving towards the song and stuff like that. And so he might be collecting a lot of those nutrients right now.  Is it a really good for fungus?  What do you want to start walking? If we?  Sandra.  I think they're also like if you want, like Assassin Vive, they're up like these online books. How does that sound like old empty journals. And so that, like a lot of that often times like that about that in the papers, like, like a little old for my bag. I wish I had come  But I feel like I'll be back. Weird things considered what kind of like  To use STS.  Human.  You ready sauce?  Let's go.  Yeah, let's go.  My grandpa and he reacts not music.  And would like, instant effects, instant effects on the mind.  What was your class Lounge? ",6301,03/03/22,220303_001_me.wav
0,"Hey sunshine. What's your name? Axel to think about?  Axel Pechanga, Jacob to the room cuz I was having his fourth interview for a company. That's really weird. It's like, Consulting for Finn. Ultimately. I just wanted to get a job in like rest, easy in that little anxious.  Yeah, I know. Fantastic.  It was like out of left field fence. He wants. He just wants to find a job that he can walk with for 2 years and then go to grad school. I know he wants to do, like most serious economic stop.  so like not like a  You have this funny is I think the really cool thing. Let me think about Reese. It's not like outside of class. And when we got to the school, like a lot of school just teaching us is like look like regular in like a teaching yourself things, right? Even if you want to do. So, I can just choose to start reading this book in Spanish and see what happens.  Like a whole life is a long time to become a lobbyist. You got it. Take down the gift.  Zoe.  That's what is 4. Put down all the way to the boss. Matheny. I'm at 2.2.  We got at us so cute. I was I was thinking like, Karen's coming. A lot of people say that a coincidence. Look at that. Wow.  Like once I cross this boundary, I always feel like I'm in late to something Lee. Yeah, I know which is the nice feeling which is why I like  good afternoon.  Yeah, let's do it. Have you watched the whole thing? What's it about?  Who is the lawyer? How did Howard Hughes die?  This is a really oh my God. I'm trying to look for it so I can finish up so much.

I remember like the most you for awhile since was out and seeping out and doesn't like in this in this it was like to be during freshman year and even sleep in the tent.  So I walked out like away from the group. I just saw them put my bag down in this like a cracked area of like like far away from the other campfire that I could see the stars, just like lay there with 6-9 with looked up in the craziest thing was  What I remember is he was nothing from that trip. The only thing I remember is that in the middle of the night since I like a dust storm and the thing is, I wasn't able to see the stars at night because of all the clouds out of line. And I open my eyes out like it was probably like 9 or 3 a.m. Or something like that. And I open my eyes, my eyes like cracked and caked with likes. And my lips are completely caked with sand, you know, and Austin. And I opened up my my whatever, and then it was like, I woke up because of the pain just been blown, like the clouds are just been blown away. If you know, I looked up like the middle of somewhere in between like my dreams and my sneak into this like you're just the most unbelievable sky. Like it was like one of those guys that you can like see like the Milky Way than like all different colors and all the lights and it's like often between sleep and just like it's somewhere. I would have it and then I close my eyes and pulled like the shot over my face. I don't remember any.  Hangouts on that trip, and not like that. One moment when I woke up in the  Put the crazy one. That's likely a fresh wins.  It was like one of those.  What time does amazing? Amazing? That like, and like, kind of like feeling of infinity, you know, that's like what, that's one. They don't get very often and I'm really looking forward to this riddle.  Sing that again. Like a natural Infinity. Is the best thing in existence. It's like when we was when we was sitting out that and the coffee with him and eat him.  That's those different moments that are just like there is nothing better than those moments. Yeah.

Does this Egyptian boy who is like super tight? Who's soup? I'm gay and he is like to button to me. It's like really and it's really like a site that uncomfortable cuz like when he likes it behind me, he's just like I whenever I look what you doing, a stretch, whatever it is, like what? Like a compromising position or whatever. You just like to look at me in the eyes of whatever. I'm just like going off the cloth. You like he gives me a really big and like deep hog like this and he was in the cost is like a friend of mine about like a koala tea and all the other things. And like talking about me and was like, like, whatever. I mean, it's like he's just like, very, very full. What I'm very, very into me. It's not like, there's this like  It's just like a different. It's like a different culture. It's almost like the whole like, male gay. Is he saying is, like, not at all, sort of like discouraged in some way with the it. Would, this it? So it's like,  He's pretty damn, not repressed.  Yeah, and so he's like very much trying to like.  Rihanna gives me like a really, really big really sweaty hog at the end. I told me actually. I'm not sure, I think he did.  Yes.  One would assume that that would that that waited this week that didn't stop him, they size but he's not very hot. That wouldn't change.  Olivia.  Flashlight.  The thing is, is that weed. I got you. Stop smoking so much weed and I only smoke except for this morning perhaps once or twice a week and it's really nice because it becomes like a I thought that's what I thought too. Cuz I've been smoking every single day. I didn't I couldn't remember the last time I took more than like a week break smoking weed. I smoke every single day and I think a lot of it was like my own sort of like I didn't actually need it. But like my mind was like, telling me that I need, you know, just like, oh, yeah, you need to smoke weed. Like this is, I know, it's like that all complex series of, like, soft justifications. As any realize that. Like, telling you this, if you just don't do it, you realize that my mind is like, totally just lying to me is trying to get pleasure. And, you know, I mean, it just being like always, you know, you  Duplicate.  There are so many. Snow days.  Kathleen play. This is this someone's cupcake snowing saving this cupcake.  I can also spell if anyone wants another piece by piece of it.  Arcade Smithtown, stick.  I like.  Just thinking about all the baked goods.  All the good ones that have Ethan in the  One of the great tragedies of my life. Is that my my my grandpa is a Beka?  I had a little like a pastry shop and he trained in France for like 3 years like back and was like an apprenticeship in the stuff and she runs into the Swedish comes in today. I'm here. And at least you know, and he was a Mazda assets apartment. So my dad grew up like me walking the bakery.  Play.  Yeah, but he was he was supposed to watch because that the Socialist state had some made it really hot for small businesses. And yeah, so like no one showed up to walk. It took like three years to fire a Waka even if they had a video of them like on like stealing a bunch of cash from the register, you know, and so that was seven walk is on payroll and then they never showed up because like the unions had together with the governments and even unionized over small businesses. And so that it just became really. So they went bankrupt. I got to watch like a lot of bankruptcy meetings when he's young and he's not, you know, it's like, it's crazy crazy in or is he can suck benefits or like, Socialism or anything like that? He just when it's done wrong, I can really hot people.  Anyway for the great tragedies of my life is that I haven't been able to offset it cuz he walked like non-stop every single day. And there was no one else that pretty much my grandfather went when he retired. He told he just sat down he's like I am not going to stand up. I'm not going to make any more.  Baked baked goods, do anything for the rest of my life. So, I've never tried any of his like recipes, like one of those recipes was like the King's favorite, you know, the thing cuz it's king. The king wants came to the small town and ate his pastry, you know, and cited as like one of the best ones he's ever had. It's like all of these recipes and all of these things are just disappearing.  Cuz now he has Alzheimer's and he died definitively cannot know, my grandmother. My grandmother is 24 hours, you just  Doesn't want to take advice from him.  She'll trust. I like home catalogs North.  But yeah, I like I imagined and my mom tried it and she said, it was the best thing, the best pastries. And he said, she's at a decent in my life. It was like a mocha meringue cake.  That's fantastic.  And lays off like a of like really, really finally, finally like soft whipped cream as well as with those meringues and in like a mocha about that my mom, describes it all the time and I just feel so sad because I'll never ever be able to taste his mustache wax.

I'm going to get started as well. Block vibes.  Lisa.  He said he would know, but that went out the window. I was fully prepared to quit and then March 1st, March my best. And so yeah, and then I come to you on March 5th. Any kind of hate and I felt like you broke the times, everything goes an agreement. And so  Could I have the Vape?  Hit The Vape.  So, I want to do.  All I'm thinking about is hitting the Vape, very short shorts shorts.  A about this.  Goddard Middle and then you got it with me. Yeah.  Priceline.  kids parents, everyone's corporations like control the chemical makeup of  like Nicki like with profit capacity is like, yes, it's telling people we're condemning it, but I was also like me and  Play Indian classical for talking about us.  About this today at the ecosystems work, son. We're not people.  What might want my woman therapist?  What what my therapist said to me the other day is that like she didn't like the day, like, a couple months ago and it's really like stems. My, my nicotine. You said Joshua, they used to smoke, like sap and I can have several cigarettes a day. And now that only happen sometimes. But most of the time, I like I only smoke a cigarette a day type thing. And if I'm around of April at the bait and that happened, because she told me about how like you notes about the tobacco is a sacred plants, you know, there's nothing that's wrong with the backhoe. I it's, it's a sacred plant all across  What is the sacred plant and its benefits considered sacred, all across the Americas by indigenous, groups out? All the pain has been that way for like for like forever. And the problem is not like the plant itself, you know, like it. She said like some of the psychic grandfather fire likes his like system back up that you would like that. Like there's nothing wrong with tobacco. What's wrong with it. Is the known the use of it in a abusive way as if like you were doing like a ritual, like that's meant to be like a sacred ritual and he would just totally abusing. It's in the way so that you'll pick me here on holy and you're making it a good being disrespectful to set of the ancient traditions and being disrespectful to the plants and you being disrespectful to sort of, you know, you're just it's a total overabundance in that manner.  That's not bad to smoke necessarily. It's it's a no, it's an old and ancient thing or just having that respect for the plants and having a respect for the actual. So that's like the thing you're engaging in.  Is important. And like a I had that was just like, oh, yeah, like I'm going to let me make it a really nice thing when I have my like daily cigarette and I'm going to like, have a coffee. I'm going to likes. I'll have about like one cigarette. I don't be really mindful about it. And then I'm going to come and go on with my day and like, allow that to just feel my day and instead of instead of abusing the thought.  No, I just, I just take the whole thing, the whole cigarette, and if I do smoke, I'll smoke. I'll smoke smoke two times. And just that mindfulness. It's like totally decrease. I've been smoking for a long time and it's like it totally decrease my my levels of smoking. It's like bassett's of smokes, actual plant itself, and I think,  Dr. Evil  It's it's it's kind of evil the Vapes. I mean that they also I control you in a way that cigarettes don't know what the cigarettes. But they, they like control. Do you like every single move, you know, not like and it's wack just feel so the way in which psych, I don't like. So we had to like Oscar at but like your body like compels you to cuz I could just compel.  like to the  So different than a cigarette which is like $1,000 worth that was really helpful to me to sell stock. Considering. It's like a as a mole, like sacred and really mindful practice like a stepping outside and just taking that moment to like breathing the universe, you know, and it just feel. Sort of like  and that was really positive. Yeah.  Yeah.  100%.  And also makes me that something to do with nature, you know, like I think smoking to like force you to step outside is a huge to Torrance, as well as for like over overindulgence, you know, you got to go outside. Yeah, and then you associated with sort of nature with fresh air with some of that the song without the mindful moments, and it's just that positive cycle. Yeah. I think you should have take away some of that when you smoke inside was not be weed or tobacco, because it becomes a little more.  Like, there's no.  Control and like plan.  Excel quick. Yeah.  100%.  it like puts itself in the position where I can be at always, you know, it just slides in that right next to sort of your toothbrush and your whatever I was like, this is like a sort of like feature of your environment now,  So many of those these days, babe.  Yeah, that was what that was. Okay.

So I'm not like and I'm not using it for the purpose of tack, but I'm using it as a means to a night because I didn't part of the what happened in this in this lifetime, with this Mackenzie guy. Is that like he brought in this other guy to be from Amazon? And why was, why can't Amazon to be like the CTO? And then he was like, see. See, see, it's setting this up to you or even, this was my idea and I have it and then you just totally like stole it. And then I like Town II towns him about it.

I know it's like it's a different way of thinking what you said of like thanks and have like I'm in a cascading manner rather than thinking like I like big picture sort of like just think like a like long chains of series of processes and if you stop to think like that, then everything should have holes in the place.

You know that song I think I left my conscious. I think she's having just a crisis of self cuz she's like who the fuck am I?  Who am I? I am I condemned.  I'm fucking in the sky.  Right. It's really cool stores like this or like a real fucking cool set.  Play Play the song. Where were you with something in that area? At all, like writing media sort of like at least at least the like so that was like a springboard into like something else. That's pretty that's just pretty cool podcast. So fucking phone include  Could I please get a double double fries and a vanilla shake with onion and a days?  That was probably the original like, the original Parliament.  Would you Joyce, will you come?  When do they give us something? That's pretty used to. Thank you. Thank you.  When you open a door next to a rehab?  And you do.  Brickell to you.  This is a weird time, painter.  I go giving birth to him and his girlfriend.  I love that.  I know you just kept asking.  But that's like it does the guy make make money off of him.  Probably things that we've got to be great, make a little side hustle. I've been in the conversation with both of them at the same time who came out, like personal matters for like an hour.  Is right off to the big winds, knocked everything down and he found them both in like it, the whole way of the office on that hallway of the office and then outside right by the thing on this light, on the back in the area soda, and we just talked for like an hour. I'd like a long conversation with two professors about like possible things and everything like that. It was a really lovely. I think it's a little too assets is in one month and they both looked to me, like, believeland as well. She really bonded with him is a him too. And like, I've been, like, I showed up in the office hours office hours, want and like we pull, I briefly as wise as really nice.  I want to explain like wipe been like super on things like that. I was like really likes very like, very tight to go to get it done. Like as I would like, was obviously like I was communicating with you and stuff like that. I sold him grew a little like, like, like like a little like a little little not like, you know, I'm not even doing anything at all in and out. Like I realize that like I do, but like this is really just like  Rather than being said of it like a roommate set of traps of the bonding thing. This is like Simon's trap this ER and then it sort of like that like the that you and Ari will like, you know, taking over the planning and everything like that. And then it became like oh, well, I guess this trip as like roommates as like a scene in a year trip together or is this your trip to cre? We just would have liked hanging on it and then it became a senior trip is like roommates. You know what I mean, or is this Simon strep? And that was like a little Annoying. I think like I do know like obviously that's not understand. I just I like that's part of the reason why I've been like ",1830,03/07/22,220307_007_me.wav
0,"Gas me up. Which way. Do you say?  Who sang what they say? I love them enough for you. That's insane.  The Joshua Tree set football.  It's not a happy ending for the Mystic.  He sounds like the hardships that come from this, it's like really close and I feel like that there's an initially that comes from diagnosing. A problem deciding TV back many times after that, but like us in the long run, do a little, you know, like it's not like something you could do ovaries. So, I need to consider whether on the side with her New York still, my base of operations, excetera excetera.  he was like,  Are just like getting people on from various backgrounds, you know, and you know, like the tell Jonathan Pacheco Bell.  Let me really funny. I think he would love that.  Screaming.  Read. So what I like the language that people use to talk about housing and select from lot of groups that door which is like where like people about like random not having his bike. He went on it once just sitting and like the first post he saw was like like black man, like like what to do.  Oh my God.  Answer like, there's all these apps were people just talked in. So what do you want? What I want to do or what he's charging me to do. Is it to gather all of these different references to? And I thought this is something your model you were talking about the other day, the bias one is still, I gather these different language that uses of steroid work on reframing so that like in advocacy you can like and work with those like work with those issues and like, figure out how to reach out because he says you're going to have your opposition but the party that you're going to have your position and then the most ripe and that's where reframing really is like important. So yeah, I'm going to start looking through all. These warnings are going cuz I told him a little bit about how is alienated from Scarsdale going to be like. So I can I ask  Play quiet and Ashley. I don't know. Cuz like I didn't for a long time in the scheme of South Asians are not on, you know, block and lot. Next people. Like I just like I don't I didn't feel valid claiming anything. But I was when I got here I start realizing like microaggressions and he likes it was really like validating and I don't like talking a lot about like he was like I'm warning you you're going to need to be able to a lot to read through these. Like, I can't even stomach like next door and Citizen and like Facebook groups all we know grandma wants like, Gina and Gina might have to go let you know that like in Edgewood. Like meeting house for like old white ladies.  Happens.  Because if being willing to defined as being so affordable housing, like, for people who is like, then it has to be more person, median, income of an area. Edgewood is technically the median income.  So you're fertile hike, low income, housing. It's going to be.  But even like a redistribution, right? I mean, it's just like  What was the taxes? But cheaper but the housing is like substantially cheaper than in Quaker Ridge, right? So, the clock is like going to everyone, but the money that's going in is like not an even distribution Oye. So people in like that, this badge with school gets just as much even though that he's go people more taxes. Yeah.  Be the same dude for a litter. Not pretend that this kid did was one of the arguments people make about the ocean. Like, we just don't want, like, our property values to go down, right in, gation and ducks and found that like, if you for fortunately, look at like the ink block people, but they're still not that amount of people who cut a full of culture. Then Right theory this can had was that because Scott and mostly in Jewish and immigrants feeling or sentiment of you made it here, other people should have also like, they just have to like work hard, right? Like there's also. Correlations are salesman, for example, like with wasps.  But the interesting thing about Scott like some of its old money, but it's like a lot of emotion. It's just like is not new.  You really collecting data, but like just from like culturally speaking with like people and like looking at like income as Meadow and Edgewood tend to them related wealth. Where is like in places like Keith code and Quicken. Are you sure you can't measure that?  Cuz the only the only thing that would does come off from that. Is that like there is like no one I know in like he's gotten who  Was she well-liked in these goat except a select the pot of heathcote Road, you know, that goes by the middle school and Murray Hill, you know, that whole like that that entire Hillside there in the Center of Scottsdale, is a totally different story from everything out.  Say, if you were, if you remove that from the actual should have picked from the acting like house, like what Adam lives in whatever, it's a vet, the same who is considered the best yet. That's what that's what I mean, but  Because it cuz you can't like it. Because like it when you goes like, the area right around me. It's like some parts of it. Is like I like I like definitely like  It's like the houses is like slightly bigger, you know, him slightly, but it's like much clothes. I was wearing, like, housing for. I'm done talking. I'm just, I'm just saying that, like, those people on the hill. That's like the Jen. So I crazy generational Mouse, the thing about Rochester and like diversity, is that? Like, there's all sorts of like, look at our Asian population to come here to Barstow. And is that like they're like the whole host of studies and South Asians moved diverse, like white people, which is prima.  Code for like Jews and immigrants but like not all Italian immigrants. There's like they don't repair. My parents moved to Scarsdale because my dad and knew everyone who is it in? His walk was like ended up being Jewish and they all like all go to Scarsdale day. Whatever. I'm at. Like I said something about slightly like it, not like it but that many a stereotype where was like, oh, you know, Jews are good with the education kind of stuff and then we'll go do that because they have a good educational ethic and stuff like  A measured cultural phenomenon, like people like like immigrants, especially in the Affinity between Asians and and juice.  Very strong, very strong, FNAF animation.  There's a strong affiliation between Asians and Asian immigrants to America and Jewish and Jewish people in America because they both like wealthy minorities why we are there.  No, I think it's a sign that something is usually correct me when I say that whatever.  Datum is a single.  The Thai in love.  Correlation. No, but there it is. It is it. The Asian population is far higher in in in Scarsdale than it is in any of the towns around it.  But I like the white Catholic old money.  So like you can put as much it is, but there still could be. So this is one reason why it's like data isn't actually the way to go in times of like understanding this Triton to a culture.  No, I mean, I mean, it's it's a it's like in the in the in the same, like the Aether, some of the place that people like, say these things and hate tell these stories in the something.  The unnatural sort of like weird cultural things cuz they're not.  Like octopus.  Will this thing most neighborhoods in Scottsdale, especially is like something, which, like, I feel like, I feel like, I feel like you could, like reasonably expect expect to be a segregated play neighborhood with historical preservation and historical preservation.  But it's like more like we did this to stop development.  I thought it said it shouldn't. It shouldn't?  Like it and it turned into like a story. Could I'd rather do like that.  I care about like that.  Create a reply to feeling real estate.  I mean, yeah, those two people that game that you like, I'd like for like interviews with something three of them again.  Commercial Banking for Life between interest general interest cost to  in grad school.  I guess you got your collab.  Like a part of me. Like, I don't really care about it.  The problem is that like everyone like it's going to be it's going to be like a really expensive to like buy those houses cuz that's so like whatever after the New Deal. Hold. Well.  For people who? Well, I think it's generally it's like a good thing to Eddie or people can like, like from low-income. Whatever can accumulate wealth, that has a very much, like most places before the 20th century. And I think it's a good thing for people to want to, like, use the market till I can build roads and no family, but it's bad when the basis of that is housing, because then it is when you threaten people like that, even though they suck people around like next door or like, I don't want to take the, the home valued like cuz like, like, like from there.  Case, is it?  Increases. That's like,  Address in general.  And so it would make sense that home that is in.  semi that has  Right. Seems like a like. Oh, no.  I mean, okay, that's invested like  diesel power.  I I don't I do. The thing is, the thing is is that  These sorts of things like they don't like stuff that is like hundreds of different like things. I like reading about like most of them. They, they addressed those kind of those issues especially like in the field and got like the other side that says like no, whatever. And then it's not like duplication that same, you know what I mean?  You saying that like like you can just assume that like they haven't done that day so we were right.  No, I know that. There are a lot of a lot of fields do that. They told ya, I know.  Structure which is this home ownership. I agree with that. How do you do that?  No, no, that's that's a really that's an interesting economics question.  How do you disinfect? How do you shrink?  Really? Cool, Simon. Could you do me some questions with regards to building housing? That's meant to be demolished question.  And could you also do a big favor as what those like those green Crush crashes?

I don't, I don't really understand. I want to sing.  I didn't finish.  Take out the extra line. I didn't mean to take it down a little bit. Yeah, but then you take off that.  Going to take that time.  Oh, that's at. That's how you do. Listen to vape thing on this.  I'm not sure if this makes sense to someone reading.  That's good because it's like it.  If I guess you could say some might just a tribute this to sort of, you know.  Tired to set up like the general Distributing distribution that the effects that come with it, you know, come with nothing makes sense. Then sort of like the class discrimination by the cops like he was him.  Yes, well, then people might think that you're talking to use.  The demographic. Commits the demographic makeup.  2.  But what you mean by that, doesn't fully what you're like, point of this line, I guess and the other part that the non racial segregation index.  This is like a racial issue. It's not just like an incoming. How does that have to do with the affordable housing?  This reflects a shoe. Yeah, but my question is like the segregation that might just be about. This has nothing to do with the reason. Why isn't because of like demographic. It isn't wanting to integrate segregated communities, like in the primary. No answer actually use it at all. But I think he would that with that because I think it's just coming down 2nd generation.  And be than this should be fast.  Maybe something cool you can do for you can know. Keep me. Or you can keep that a bike when you talk about this, when you talk about this thing about like it.  Tribute to the Costas communication. I feel like it. You should just say that that make sense in the context of the post. I didn't see the next post so you can take it out for you.  How many guys cars are sold to income but segregation Scottsdale?  Runner's Depot something, you know.  What is runs deeper than nothing. Yeah, that's good.  That makes a lot of sense. Make. I like to party.  the demographics to say,  Yeah, like organic shape.

Is any maybe make this a little like these anyway to get that for, like, taking text mole or something for, like, or like making it, not that one? I guess, you can come if you move it.  You know, somebody, that's because you have this instead of this side alignment.  I think they looks like I'm the  Looking.  I'm sure speculations.  I don't I think abstract speculations. It's like you will we have to stop talking over the issue of us portable housing housing with.  Yeah.  And I also think that that like there's so much that background is is it be better to have a different organic shape in that if I had if any at all in this there's so much, you know. Just make it a little harder to read.  I love that.  You don't know what reason, I'm bubble up a little bit.  Dissection, or what? Can you do?  Raise this issue with parents in the PT.

If the parent studies show me them.  You know, the kids give me. I don't know what I've done. That's it.  You know, they have to be able to bring like boom to the table.  What?  Of course, you said.

So but there's this like I'm like, I'm questioning like why I should be for the next with these late this lady. And like they're like to that was right. This is acting crazy to me, right? Cuz the one like an opiate-like type, please.  Okay, so Thursday 3rd, like there were two Labs that like an interesting one is like that. So this is one lamb in which there are like that is a computational psychology lab and they do brain stuff as well as like that most of that cognitive and cognitive type lab in which they're trying to look at those things in orbit and Opie guys. A bunch of like me or scientists a bunch of psychologists like perception, some floss Fizz in like whatever. They're like 20 people and not 25. Something really big professors but like a couple PhD people a lot of PhD like upcoming people hugging, the Princeton cognitive whatever, however I was at least 20 people, you know, it's only 3, I got those. However, if you look at the computational lab, the language Lab at the psych language lab,  By posting language. They do, you know that the other than that the stop was that why do they were like people or the moment and then  I got that. They're all the same, like, 6267 people like every single one and then  My question is so there's like okay. So should we go to the lab. She does the computational stuff language lab world. I wish I could.  None of this. Actually the one you want to be.  When I'm ovulating.  someone between  I agree, but at the same time like,  There is like I wish there was one that was like, the thing is that they won't be a perfect. That anyway, I just need to pick the people who like helping me. So.  Cuz I can like collaborate with them things interested in like language.  Psychology.  You should go get your last two texts.  Lowe's.  You got mad, I kept here with you up here. I think I'm coming from the fax to tomorrow. But today that sounds like a crazy and terrible idea.  The thing is, is that that was a success but it was like there was no reason for me. It's like I want like a hundred bad things happen in the rain, as walking toward five blocks and blocks and blocks with like feeling bad clothing so I can hold my way.

It's like, it's that I thought it was like it was like it's cool, but it was much.  But it is kind of that but it's like not you know, it's like it's, it's so cool, but it's like a little flat. Like, I still would have gotten it, but like I think they slightly mishap. I got so many things. By the way, like it. This jacket reduces down. I didn't get it cuz of style did it.

Maya I was once whether you guys have a big effect of Aging at home when you have an extra one who bit like so like when I, when I do impact because my whole back running or swimming, wait on this until we get the check, I have some tea and I should be treated as houses.  And then we'll take those out. Yes, and then and then the arugula and lots of this because like one of the principal ways in which I wonder how much is because you want to have an extra to be doing constantly so that there can be more but we can only wait like that. Nice little chopped Pizza. Sausage on that place. I think I am.  What's the weather's really depressing about that? Is that something else does old people? You have to give a rotation of a young?

That's why I like I can give me a thing to use when you come just like you was if I should try get out and start like lactive, but just trying to do what like it makes sense, you know, I could like what and that's what you're not very, very, very like. The line is very thin. Once this pretense. I got say if I could probably Pay Pal or something, doesn't pick up that I have these skills and then I'll end up like something, you know, exactly.

They have dumped you on the phone and saying you didn't even like let me say my point. The problem is is that like when you have ulcers automation, there is going to be that there is going to be that there is going to be a sense about like right now right now is a compliment like that. But you also can have like a robot that fixes all the Rope bullshittin kind of jobs outside of the controls, the ends of the nation, right?  Yes, down the line, right? If these busy. If it's like, it's business is a controlling like an Automation and so far more sophisticated system, everything can, and I can be painted at a profit will just what I won't be like that won't be any people to buy it.

Things, like that's fine. If it's just wasn't with everyone's.  Can you put in that like cord?  But I mean like the power relationship that is clear.  Oh, yeah, I'm like, I can't believe that shit.  Not like cost, something against jacks cards to write.  You can rationalize anything.  what you mean was effectively means that you have no morals, morals, that you do have because of the capacity to rationalize that a lot of people I know like that really  Don't I think it isn't, I think this talking like a lack of strength in the soul.  20, like it's nothing else. Except for like a sudden weakness.  Yes.  Yeah.  What are the shows at the conviction? Was in a convection, a conviction is only a conviction until you got to have to decide it with it. You know that it's just totally abstract don't have like view of the snow but it's it's it's even like there's something that I've like, if I was like, reduce people down to a single dimensionality. But before I was like, oh, like the most important one is the most important to see. I mean, I care who you are. But if you would like authentic, oh, yeah.  I don't know me I can load them send time and I love Simon. You know, he's he's he's like he's truly like and like it. I like Angie when she was looking mean and like freshman you'd like. I don't give a shit if that like mean, you know, I just care that they would like some of the real was. I mean, I mean, I think the timing doesn't answer you do that. You know, he he present he presents a percent so that way.  Yes.  Yeah, that's it.  Simon is different from.  Yeah, this is what you came for. The thing is, is that for the things he can be authentic. This is why I'm saying but at the same time it is like of the metric rice or like I know this is a stupid thing, but it's exhausting into something like that particularly emotional strength, you know, that is exactly. I know this isn't Valley reading, ain't you?  Yeah, what a great and rare work of art. Yes. Yes precisely.  Yo, I'm like that's like something that I can get. That's something I seen like in like songs. Like so much. She is like such a fucking strong. Like a fucking strong. Yeah. I know. I will Poinsett and she's hosting. Like she constantly teaches me athex. You know what I mean? Like it, since it is incredible.  Yeah, I know but she's also extremely excited.  Yes, and her reaction is immediate, you know, just like always that she's never liked not you know, I like I see that and Haley to you know, like Haley Haley is like fucking Leno and honestly like this is going to sound like she's only like person who could also be able to go who is all so real, you know, but that's because I feel like she's like, she's like the queen of them.  If he, or she would sit that like on, like in Detroit, like, at the center of the circle, do you know what I mean? Would like?  but that makes her really do, you know, she's putting us out, s like altimate Lee, like  Yeah, I know.  Yeah, of course. I got like a little like, you know, when you like took the reins with the room, I was like a little, like a little, like The Whispers of rebellion, you know, I didn't mean to being like even if it was like, I was appreciative and ultimately wasn't willing to take the rain to myself cuz I didn't like to know what was going on over there.  What are the most like, Captain e?  I think a lot of times.  Captains, the other.  This looks longer.  I know that puts people off me. Sometimes my captain Enos my domineering and can very much be domineering as fuck.  Yeah, I know.  .  Yeah, I know exactly.  She like finds the hole in just in Tire gates, at, you know, he doesn't let it slide.  I feel like agent like songs loses herself, when she speaks, you know, something, you know about playing insides like a self knowledge.  I think.  Yeah, I know. I agree.  Yeah.  Exactly. Exactly.

Oh, I knew that immediately when I met her. Yeah, we are compatible. You know, I think it was just like it was after you. I like  Decision that I made, you know, that like I just I'm just sticking I've just been sticking to bowl.  That's exactly the best thing about it. I was going to say it's like it's like a zero weight friendship. It's like the fucking a down jacket zero weight of one hundred percent. You could like being a fucking Community together, you know what I mean?  Exactly. That's why I should be ready. Fucking fun to start a company together.  Oh, hundred percent. I would love that. I would absolutely love to stop a company with you. I also feel like, even though would like us both being captained is not like we can both our opinion out over the other, but the other person won't like it just like it. We wouldn't, we wouldn't end opposite of like just sort of like becoming  If you know what I mean.  I like also we have like a fundamental respect for each other's cars. Which means that I can never get the arguments about the about the actual business about these things wouldn't get to the character, Nina.  Do they become character? Yeah. Yeah, I know. Exactly, exactly. But it's sometimes I hate you, but I feel it in myself to  Like, like I feel just like a husband in this argument. I feel something that will like just a disappointment in his character. I mean, yeah, you know what I mean, but like, even if I argue with you and them at like Riley ever gets there.  But you can tell me. Yeah.  But the thing is, is that the injured person, unless those things being pointed out. Just walking magnificent.  It's crazy. I like Isaac don't, it doesn't become real.  That was the best one. That's when the most destructive things about like images and and TV and stuff like that is that it makes reality of the last real thing isn't that like I called, like really appreciate the beauty of the asthma because I've seen so many pictures they have to get rid of that shit.  Shut the morally corrupt thing.  If I have enough water for.  Nothing. Really go to my old house and my, my glasses and my denada, like it to come so fluidly.  Oh, nothing, pronounce.

But like wheel reflection, like I think because that was a lot of the things I do during the day is reflection, but it's not like, I'm just going over the same like few points in my mind and just out of the same few things, you know, in the same through worries.  If it's a I'm going over the same few things over and over again, but it's really want to like the stomach drops and I thought like oh my God that's got squashed. And not like dropping of the floor of like realizing like oh shit. Like I've been bad, you know, I mean in the crew reflection,  But there's I think there's a level before that.  Yeah, I know.  That's crazy.  I kind of like, giving up.  Since I have is milk, no, I haven't given up but it's like it's like that possibility of like really knowing them. My brother's is really doing nothing partly because they don't know me and like they don't ask questions.  But Eric feel like they're still a window of a connection because he'd like to hear like, he's that both like extremely wide, they like don't have a lot of w, you know, unless those wasn't directed at like a specific idea, you know, if they do not have it it's like the entire process of communication happens. Like with the eyes with sort of like this where the South interactive it's going to be really easy. Interesting for you to see the family I come out of  A warning about the house.

If you still have a mental picture of the house or home that you lived in when you were a child.  You know, when you have like it, if you stayed that long enough to have liked it, even if you sell it, then, you know, you will retain those memories because you have like a butt like my environment changed every couple of months.

I had that when I was younger, but yeah, but I don't hate. You don't feel that way. I feel all I want to do is I want to contribute and know that. That's something meaningful. I live a good fucking life with a good fucking community.  Honestly, I think all you really want is respect. And if I have that respect for the people that it matches for that literally, all that matters to me. I think it's like, that's why I, like, how are you asking and your parents eyes and biggest thing. If I make my parents proud, if I make my parents and my friends. The Grapevine life biggest fucking life.  I think so.  That's what I'm saying. That's why that's why I like and that's what that's what I really want to have that like like a little bit of respect by way of achieving it. I mean the biggest reason kind of why I want to pay it today. Like you've done something already. You contribute its academic, what I've always done, even if you don't do it like,  And that might be like totally misguided of me and I'm ready to get totally fooled.  You know what? I mean, but it's like it. So it's sort of like once I guess that it's like, for me it's like, I'm like,  No, and no.  Good night. I'm not using it as an insurance policy. I thinking positive about that.  But like I think most of it is the feeling that like I barely learned anything so far. Like, I've, I've liked Donald, it's like felt like I'm talking about the introductory classes stock at their whatever, and it feels like I'm like hopelessly not finished with my studies.  Gracias.  Passing the main reason for wanting to do it. It's like I just feel like I haven't really. Like I only got I've seen and Clements, you know, the frontier that you know, the truth that you know, some of this sort of like it the possibility, you know, also do a lot of studying you we have prepared and all these disciplines in order to tackle these things. At the, any women undergrad in particular. It's like it's like baby Latias.  No, it isn't. It is fucking baby stops. You get a patent on the like if you see this shit like that.

Really?  I'm leaving like the ideas like ever find a deal like absent. So I can put their competition, you know, what faction apps and apps and comparison. No, cuz I think I think that means that makes it like you. You can lose it.  You know, I packed my confidence, this over the best, the best dollar, you know what I mean? Cuz if you pack it to the anxious, you know what I mean? Instead to you know, just the sauce instead of undying sort of idea of sort of like an ID ideals and pop action and you know, all that kid Perfection, but you know what I mean, but you said your problem was  Yeah, I know I can.  Hello. Hello.  Lucius Malfoy's better than you. Yeah. Yes.  Channel 3.  Yeah, that might be. That's fine. But like in the thing is is that ultimately what I think it's not like that it's based on his route. So it's just it's just that you pay assassin idea of yourself to the actions that could do it. You know, I'm not like losing a game of chaste me and something, you know, deep down. It's like it just like a method for like  Hockey's, just saw the Viking.

When you're with him because it's just like, yeah.  Up to the lake. You are almost at the one kilometer Mark and there are nine more.  Yes.  Never like I think we're like two evenly-matched Snapchats.  Like I was like I was like, I was like bad before I better things but like I don't like to get better at things like relative to all the people. I think relative to yourself. It's my favorite way.  Well, that's true.  Yeah.  Really?  I know. My life is like hard walking down here with the celebration. Yeah.  Play, I think one of the main things like about competition is that like it really just dropped from like the Buddhist teachings, you know things so you just yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know now I can send him any more experience.  All my bought two, that would have sucked.  Yacht breakfast tomorrow morning at the hotel. Continental breakfast.  I didn't mean Isis at.

The thing is is that there's we should say that we created a whole I'd only like lie about that.  That hole was only created because of that, broken zipper.  The zipper wasn't your type the other that's Troy on it.  All those, I was in. Why we went? We came back. I think that this is not the only reason.

The things that you need like a lan a little from your drunk or high self, you know, like 10. Yeah, I think it was purely allegorical fine. Yes. It is allegorical.  Find the drunkness in that they took all of it was not isn't isn't how it is allegory? If he looked like the old sous-vide like texting then actually like drunk.  Things high point is that like wine became like a symbol for like a the feel like God.  You know, I like it wasn't like it was more that isn't that like the idea of becoming like totally infatuated lost and let go into sort of like the heights that your spirits can go? Like when do Wallings office is a fucking Walling, you know that just stating they lose themselves and by losing yourself, you know, you answer the internet. So, you know, you use of entering the gods Godzilla but not like that. In the old like Islamic stop. It still says, he can't drink, but the point is that like you the point is like a, it's like an allegorical drunkenness.  But yeah, man, you know that like what? You don't need red wine. You have got it. You know, you already have like this Spirit. Exactly.  Stop being sad, like, I don't doubt that they have someone posses, you know, but like, the symbol itself is not like a natural.

If I'm in like an empty, you know, how much older when you put in just goes through, you know, but it's almost as if like, you know, the wind is trying to blow and that like, you know, like poorest of net, you know, it just slowly being wrapped around you, you know, and you just feel like you're being in, on each, no matter what you do, like the wind, the wind doesn't push it away because the wind goes through it as an, that is just the sort of thing and just collapsing on you. And you can't, you can't fucking do anything to get out of it. That's the one, he's funny. Like, said that thing, you know, the thing I got continuously bring up about know the thing about like, you know, when you go out, you know, into the real world, you know, the thing about the dreams about him trying to sort of her and shot my shot out my dreams as well. I just, I I, I  like that was some like ancient fucking Prometheus and me, you know, that just fucking re-edit add, you know, and I just, I just, I just wanted to like fucking Bunny and, you know,  Yes, and I don't I don't know. Like I I became so angry. I became so angry and only just angry. I became like so deeply sad and disgusting and I feel myself like covered in that shitt. I don't know why. I just I just know. It's it's already as well and it's as I feel in my size. I feel myself, just totally just like, you know, like a like a oil spell, you know what I mean? And I'm just trying to like shake the shit off and rub it off, and it just doesn't fucking come off. Because that shit just throbs in the liquor store in a bicycle, you know, you know, and I just and I know like the whole experience, I like, seeing the sea is like, not like it's the same. It's like, it's just like capturing me and it's not like it's it's not like anything is that? Like ultimately, like I feel like I was fucking freaked out about that because I couldn't see like nature anymore. I don't know what it was. It just became like a Vista. Like, I like a stupid fucking postcard and I was  And I was trying, I was explaining.  Human.  And there's no joy, like the people like a no, none.  An end and Simon &, Simon do it for me and I think I resisted saying that, but I think he wants with you cuz I never gave him the time for anything about her. I think it's just fucking, it's someone who like, you know, they can make babies.  But it, it it honestly like Doc than that though called her. It's not just that like she was bringing it down to the thing of humankind. It's not like some like crazy thing has become like lodged in me. I can't even like me myself when I was out that, you know, there were a couple of like moments a couple of fleeting seconds in, which should have the mountains have like, you know, and I'm trying like mythologize it, you know, in the way of the right, which I always cut in, which, like my imagination could like fill it. And I could remain in that space of that imagination and not like, you know, and just walk through my dreams, you know, as if they were, you know, because they are real, if they are real, you know what I mean, but because they are real and because they are true and not true of them that true then, you know, nouns of rock, you know something, you know, and I'm about like  And I'm thinking about notes to what this bring affection. I think one of the few things that match today, you know, and  You know that original. Original idea, you know, like three biblical free whatever. I'm going to have you read it yet, you know, but the free Biblical original certified in which in which the you know, the color that comes before the color, you know, the color of the flower before the name of the color has been substantiated, you know, that the sun itself before it was given the Phoebus Phoebus, you know, before it was given the name of Apollo, you know, Adam and Eve, you know, the god in the ad before Adam and Eve, became sort of it within it, you know, it's almost as if like still, there is a story just like crazy fucking dialectic in which in which the reality is so much more real than any kind of fiction that one can make out of it, you know, but then there is just like this on, do just happy fucking desire, you know, some like Spirit of like philosophy of some Spirit of something life within me that just wants to that once that wants  That's what the dream through at. Not just, not just walk through it. You know, I want to fucking, like, I want to fucking, like, float through it. I don't know, like, combo with the spirits, you know, as that fucking like flying around the tent, you know, just dancing in in, in that chair in those. Like, in those, like, instantaneous chambers that they make with the fucking like win, then, just like, floats away with clothes away. Without, you know, I'm used to be able to like my emotions flu, you know, when I was a kid and it's almost like this large that's been around me. It's like, I'm trying.  Define. Poeticism. I'm trying to find that dream rather than like just possibly living it. And that like trying almost, like sucks it out of me because it seems like you have changed. I can't, I can't get there anymore without sort of like strong-arming myself into it. I'm going to strong-arm myself into it and it feels like unreal the moment in which I. And so I like I fucking hate myself for it, you know, and I'm just fucking freaking the fuck out and left music for my like-for-like. Some mental health in some idea of stability, that everyone said it was like, the best fucking thing was the best fucking thing of me, the thing for me to do, you know, and I I felt like it like, it wasn't, but it wasn't just felt like I'm fuking lost myself at all, you know, it was like the last fucking thing that was like a, like a, like a prominent fucking lying through my childhood. I was like a prominent fucking lying through my life, you know, and I'm just I'm just like, I'm just fucking  Stop that because it was too like what it was. It was too like emotionally challenging. I don't know, it was it was fucking terrifying but the thing is it's not like it's I gave up the fight. But if it if you feel that way, if it feels as if like when I dropped that instead of gave in to myself to be happy, you know, my mind is clear. My mind is empty, you know, it's true that my mind is clear in my mind is empty, but that's because the spirit sound like dancing there anymore. You know, it's like they're not like it, the not fucking like teasing me and like it. And I'm bringing my spirit till I get the scariest places in the third, whatever. They're just, they're just not just left me. It's like they stopped speaking, you know, everything is stopped speaking. And ultimately that is, all it is, is a, is a sad and empty and somehow like it. It's becomes like an assignment and Anna CMC and the face of that is like the faceoff, like Simon money.  That that became like somehow like the the face of everything that I'm fighting against.  And I notice closer to it, but I am. I'm I'm like, you know and somehow like yes, I have this like spirit in this dream in the sotavento pissed off, but somehow I just feel myself like, you know.  Having more in common with like a calm side, bro, then I do with the poet. You know what I mean? Having like a, you know,  And I just I just I just don't know what it is within me that said that like that somehow like stuff is like this missing those things. You know, I'd like silly that's like like like these silly. The whole desire is it, you know, I'm these these ideas about myself but I love those ideas and I don't want to lose them. You know, I don't want to, I don't want to lose that. I don't want to lose my pretension. I don't I don't want to lose any of that.  Does anything with him? So I think the reason that you fucking left music in like, left that life behind so would have killed you. I I, you know, I don't know that. Like it, you could have fucking like survived. I don't think anyone could, you know what? I mean? That you'll have to confront his like you have the like,  You and Emmett. I I felt this to before in like I think of, you know, fuck times the first feel this is like  You know, then likes, who isn't like a more lies, but it's like in the mat, you know what I mean? And it's just, like, cable and Mike lives in like, a lion out like in York and has like a little, like pasture like, out in Connecticut that I like are we is but like he's no fuck, you know, and like you have to. Look like what is, what is life, you okay? With being would you rather be than go? Then that person would you rather be Cobain, you know, then like Julian Casablancas or something like that. The thing is, is that I don't, I don't I don't even like  Ssss.  It's not about like stability and structure itself. Isn't that freedom that we were talking about? It's not, it's not, it's not that I I am, I'm willing myself to destruction, you know, destruction, but I think that's where that's at. Just fucking chasing chasing chasing, really considering like yourself and your being and just like from the external world that, you know, what I mean, and not consider yourself. I think that's that's where I can be an end. This might be like, your body's overcorrection, you know, like it's like the body sort of like ruling you for a minute and being a man, licking killed like you need to slow down and it's like, you know, it's like the doctrine of the mean. It's like, how do you get to the mean? If your wife on one side? You over? Correct? I know, but the thing is, is that right now? Like I was running for a reason.  Yaniv over and and you stopped running for a reason to. Yeah, I know but the thing is that the other reason is cause catching up, you know, you know, it's it's it's it's like that I was I was running and I I was I was running and I was running from I wasn't I wasn't running into you know, and I  I just, I just, it's it. It's like, I'm, I've gotten my fucking like, foots talking, like a me know, and that Bastrop is like, happiness. You know what I mean? It's not make if that makes a way to describe happiness, you know, but like not like just know I'm not talking about happiness of of the, of the, like, the true happiness that I have felt all that unbelievable, spiritual Sublime, Joy off of that. It's more of just a lack of anxiety of like toys or whatever and it's like that. I've I've I've become caught in something. And and the thing is is that the bad that was meant to be caught in that trap, you know, it's catching up to me and is it is it is it is going to fucking like 10 Mi IMS out and I feel I feel like this this  Knowing so it's time to pack up and go, but the thing that you should pay attention to is that like needed to get caught in that trap. First of all, I think they're fucking house for you, know what I mean? If you want cat spitting like a fucking hurricane-like.  Chat with sausage out of like, so who knows what Cliffs, you know, we're right around the corner for you. If you would kept running and like maybe you needed to get caught in a trap and now and now it's time to go rent. I think, maybe you stayed like a bit too long, but I think, but I think the thing is, like, you got to go back to the middle. If you can't return to that, that place of like that, where you were on the edge of the cliff, and now you're on the edge of another are you feel like you've got to go to the middle and this was like, I need to get to the middle now. It's like the fucking you overshot it. But like the reason you probably overshot it was because of your shopping. A hundred percent. I was I was I was I was  I didn't know it's it's times like pack up and go in a  but it's like, it's like  It's like these trades, you know, it's like the chest, like, we were talking about. It's not like it.  When it's like it's not that like one's mental, health is sort of like unnecessary thing in the boggin, you know, in all of the sort of like it gets to that sort of like on the engine Sublime Sublime Joy. You know what I mean? Like it's the that. Like that I would have thought. I was like that. I was searching for. I don't I don't believe that anymore. Right? But the problem is that I'm not even like fucking sure what I believe anymore. You know, it's like the very concept of belief is is is it's not that, you know, it's like it it is like before I could stand at the precipice and, you know, feel the wind and the end of whatever. And just some just ancient forces. And I would, I could just I I could just like they think they would rise within me like some fucking like wings and some like winged Beast, you know, but that's about as it should be. But now I stand at the precipice.  I don't feel anything. You know, I don't feel, I don't feel anything. It's like, I was, it's like I don't I didn't feel anything for the river. I do not feel anything for the valley. I didn't feel anything for the mountain. You know, I don't know. I did every single little like thing. It just, it just like, it was like a, it's like a spa, Fresno flame, you know, it was like, it was in a food lights, the spot, you know, I'm like fucking cracking the spot, but the fucking like, flame doesn't stop. It just doesn't catch anymore. And so, all I want to do is throw myself off the precipice and was at least feel the wind, you know, just fucking like it, you know, I'm not in my stomach dropping, you know, the same fucking feeling not like that. You can like live, vicariously through the imagination to do the spirits, but now it's like my my life. I need to live that I can't just like whatever. And I don't mean, I don't mean that I don't mean suicide here, you know, although that's wonderful and one like 11 sort of like  What was one conclusions. Sad, but it's almost like my dreams. Aren't enough anymore, you know, and now it's time to live. You know, now it's like it's fucking time. Like, it's almost like I called I called, just like, make that feeling for myself anymore, make that feeling for myself anymore. I have to, I have to fucking, I have to fucking jump off, you know, I have to make, I have to make some like real fucking choices and allow my life to become someone else's dream rather than my own. If that makes any sense. It's only like like not someone else but like just like, yes, like I'm I'm I have to, I have to  it's like the third that the currency of my child that has been spent, you know, and now it's like a it's time to actually live those vague premonitions and imaginations, that that spirit, and that those dreams that I thought I could just feel through feeling it, you know, and now, I have to feel it through, living it and because I have to feel it through living, I have to make some like, like real fucking choices and now, it's now it's a chessboard, but somehow it just feels like 10 times and was then the dream  Yeah, and so really like any of this, this was my entire fucking Junior using going to class. I stopped, like writing paper. I stopped calling people. Like, I just stopped, like I stopped doing  Anything and everything, you know because like what the to do anything is said to not, do a million other things. And so at least I was fucking keeping possibilities open and I was keeping like, who I could be open, maximum potential maximum, potential energy, you know in like sure, nothing was realize but like innocence everything was also could be realized and could be, like, imagine. You know what I mean? And like, I could fucking scenarios for myself of like who I could be in, who I was and who I would in a way. Like that's like  That's what we've been doing for a long time. And that's what you did, as a crack in the end. You fucking you, you would not like, I'm going to be, you know, this the motherfuker who like eats wood chips or whatever that fucking Christ, the teacher. I don't throw a punch like that shit. Is that she's over in this has this is like what I was saying about. Like all that a personality is, is like that by the. I think you made a lot more of those choices in your life on Shake. I think you've made a lot more of those unshakable choices like fully fucking really, to be like,  Holy faak, like it might, like the foundation of my very belief is begin. But I think you have a lot more beliefs that like, Jake, like, I don't think you would ever like treat someone really bad that you can't believe you have about songe. You know, I'm and some of the beliefs you have about yourself. Like I think you have more of that. You've all Ross alized and crystallized through like fucking like, you know, where I work and thought and like feeling of like, oh shit, like the currency of Youth is up. Like that's that's what's I'm feeling, you know, that's cuz I know better by now, you know, he has his, his crystallized relief or like they're there, their they're fake gold. They're going to turn to dust as soon as they get exposed to like if you know, fucking hard it's strong and it's like  It's going to last man in. So I think, like, I think you have more ground to stand on the new job. I know. I just, I just feel like a I just feel like for a very long time and thank you for thank you. Thank you for that.... Like those coming down a little bit.  I am and I know like I've made some good pot just as with those characteristics, you know what I mean, you know. And and shit that will last me, you know, high-quality stuff. You know, how quality beliefs high-quality about choose? Not nothing. Nothing nothing, you know, but like the thing that like fascinates me about like home site is that you can, it roll it. It's relatively, do everything. You know what I mean? Is that, is that, is that like you? You don't have to make any any single Choice, like the best thing about this project. For instance? I don't have to choose which was to write down, you got them all, you know, and I'll just got them all but also manifest the mole, you know, at once. And it's like I feel myself like wanting the start of like capture the whole, you know, but it's like it's almost like I have this like these two fools is within me that was out of the poet that can like that. But that that person that can create a single symbol of single wide that can stand by everything at once, you know, a single like this.  Top dislike, Singularity, that can be, you know, a totality, you know, that the microcosm is represented in the macrocosm, you know that like, you know, without of the Divination, you know, the beliefs like that grounds divination right to it. There is absolutely nothing random in the universe. Writes it for any little throw any of the men who like microcosm is reflective of the macrocosm writes. It. Like my thing is not like that. Tension has not been resolved, you know about tension has not been resolved in me. So I try to do everything, you know, at once and I'm totally incapable of doing everything at once, you know, and that's why I like ultimately like I I I fucking enjoy these. Technocracy is like control and nice. Like these crazy fucking like things like that, because if like, I have the possibility of capturing everything and doing everything and extending my own capabilities Beyond Myself, you know, the crate 100 means I can do a hundred different things. I can leave out every single possible.  Like sitting before the chessboard, my favorite thing to do with my, my ideal chessboard, whatever would be take one move and then play out the entire game until you realize. Oh, okay. Let's take it all back. You go back to that fast fucking move. You do the next move and you play everything all out, you know any do that every single assertive step of the Johnny, you know know I know they can't even do that, you know, but I can almost do that.  I know, I know, but it's so, the thing is, is I have stuff to do but like a lot of that brute force and is currently do, which is like restricting the realm of possibility to like, you know, the 10 best, like the faustina, the most, you know, exactly what things can follow from that, you know, and then like just exploring the possibility and the thing is is I'm like a couple steps into exploring the Sicilian, you know, not that, you know what I mean. Like, a lot of different like, you know what I mean, so fucking chess player, but he's probably like, I don't know, poorly rather, you know, there's, there's some massive Gap that he's in the same way that like, yeah, you know, like a lot. I but like, you don't know a whole lot about like, fucking like chemistry.  What it is like, it's just straight-up. It's a willingness to be God in a fucking Godless world.  But that's what, that's what, like the life cycles are for. You can't do it all in one life and like, in the fact is that, like actually going, like,  I do not particularly reveal. Like if it is true that the world is ordered a ride in that fractals, you know, the only way to discover what is so I can study one jewel in the  I know it's it's it's absolutely terrifying. And the thing in the thing is, is that, like I just feel like I'm becoming like, my, my soul is  balancing between and liking extremism right now in the sentiments, like I  Like, every single little like a salt on that soul, that comes from CMC. That comes from Simon, you know, it's like pushing me to just, you know, throw myself into like, you know, to just destroy my life, you know, because the structure is just odious to me, you know, because it's like, it's just, it's just, it's just, you know, like, you just just fucking, like, go crazy. I don't know, you know, to put the stuff, those wood chips back on the, you know, the tide on the 10th of graduation. You know, I'm just pissed on the chodesh, you know what I mean? Like, like, I don't know, just the Justin like, and just some bass impulse to fucking, like, throw it, throw it all away.  I remember one time just like going crazy talking to Haley about this like absolutely absurd. Adida life. You know what I mean? Like, we don't know anything about this fucking place about ourselves. We no fucking nothing and this is like nuts, like, it's fucking crazy. Most people just act like a fucking not just not just normal knowledge. They claim they have the knowledge, you know.  Those people that don't even want to like look me and you know, that's I think that's like the thing. I've come to hate the most of the, you know, it was already 2 is like contact. If it doesn't like that, you know, and there's just there's no fucken like a knowledge man in this game with you and like, I use game cuz I think the best word, you know what I mean? Like,  I fuck your fucking like seeing here with you. Fail your to do that over four years, not wanting felt that from him. Yeah, I know, none of it. And that's just so, you know, what the fuck am I doing spending time with you? You know, it's it's it's it's it's it's almost like  it's almost like,  and,  It's like I've come to like, she's made me like I care about like, and this is like, I feel like everything that you just added in and not like that. Like something that substance in the eyes. You know what, the same thing we talked about, what time in the sunny, I was just searching for outside watching for that. You know, that like the thing and he does look at me. He looked at me in the eyes last night, you know, and it was like, it was very strange cuz I haven't like, seeing him in the eyes for that long, you know, but it was. So, it was the same thing that like almost I saw and showed off his eyes, it was.  That was it. I know it's just existentially terrifying. Like he, like there is something about him that just like, terrifies me and it is choices and things and that he's made in life. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's like, it's like a void. Just that just like, it's killing my spirit. You know, I need like, I need like help, you know, I mean, I need, I need people to like, you know, I like when you look in Port, has he no talking about Zeus alive, you know, that that one of the artists, you know, board hasn't Zeus a lock? Would like to look through each other all the time, you know, and they like they only become great friends. The lifetime, you know, and they would like to create a sort of like little things they got that and they would even just like stay a couple of words about each other, you know, and like on in a magazine with something, you know what I mean, but that thing that like shows you that like this possibly knows me and knows my spirit and nose my nose.  It is mutual Aid, you know?  The only do I feel that but like I also just like felt like, he inspires such horrible feelings and you sometimes, you know, like yesterday like it. Like when I was when I was thinking about that like money shots as well. I hate being in an economic relationship with him. He's with the waspa seemed to be in an economic relationship with. And the thing is that it almost like it's sometimes it like bored like I have to throw up with him once you know, you know because honestly he is he is like I gave him like, you know, 7000, you know, even even even even though I don't know. I don't think he even spent it. I think he a Catholic like, you know, whatever it like puts the right now, but that's, that's mine. You know, that wasn't, what was accounted for, you know, like, I accounted for everything. You know, I'm even if I did, and I know that I can't. The thing is that it's like, totally bad faith in me to think that I can, that I can get any of that back after I gave it.  It's bad faith, and we're operating in, like a legalistic frame, you know, I know, but he's making me, but he's like, made me. It's like a stick left money, you know, and love is a stickler for money. But like, it's, he's made me like, like, like angry because of money, you know, and not just that. But it was just like there was just like, slide like disgusting, like feeling in which should have like, I can like, I'm like running up against his total.  just sort of, like,  Like fucking like, greed in are a mean, and I'll just, I'll just agree. But like, fucking like this fucking like wall of all the, you know, this is mine, you know? And, like it and like that was like, I can feel myself walking up against it, you know, and if I start like, like, pushing on it, you know, it's like he just come out when he gets angry and he gets  Related to that car crash, you know what? I mean? It's like not my fucking problem. And that's that's that's the same thing with like egg knowledge into humanity and he doesn't do it because you have knowledge, the humanity in South. So how the fucking year you or whatever? But it's like it's like  like why the fuck would you quit? Why would he give you those pesos back? No, no, no. No, he wouldn't, he wouldn't even then I want it but  The system that fucked in that led to the bullying that would like his dad and his own fucking world. Is that like, you know, every man is an island that you have to fucking answer. It's the conservative talk. Now the thing is that he didn't even on that, you know, and the thing is  But the thing is, I'd like more and more. I just I feel  It's like now I'm like now I if I am to like it, you know that now it's time to live those dreams. You know that the only way to actually get that feeling back isn't you can't you can't get it back, just vicariously by thinking of it anymore, you know, you can't get that feeling anymore. Just just threw that. You know, I can come in like thick is, but like now is the time in which, you know, the dream is actually lived, you know, the story is being written, you know, the time that the times I recoverable, you know what I mean, and and, and,  And I'm starting to realize it. Like the most important decisions that we make other ones about the community and the paths and the channels are in which we build, you know? Oh, yeah, I'm stop. I'm stopping and starting to get that, you know what I mean, but that like the community that we built that date date this Channel and structure our entire lives and the influence us like extremely deeply and and nothing is made me more like spiritually, sick over the course of my like over the over the course of the past couple years of like top three is living with Simon and not shit. Like I don't know what else would have not seen nothing that I can't think of anything that's like in the past few years, but has made me more like they feel that has been a while since we went on me that my friendship with Simon.  I'm like, what the fuck do I make of that? You know, and I know, you know, I made some fucking I mean some fucking choices, you know.  and it's like, I'm almost just like,  I like love him. But like I need like, put on my oxygen mask, you know what I mean? I need to get as far away from his like, disgusting rhetoric. I need to get as far as fucking way from his truck from all of these, like, these supposed values than just like, totally locking me in, you know, drowning me.  Ifucking made my mind up. Like I am. Like I am done with this, man. That's like, exactly exactly how I felt like, I cannot like, if, if like, if I can do it, like, I do not want to spend another fucking s around him every moment that I like make is like a moment of my life. Just feels like being drained out of, like, one of those like, Harry Potter on the fucking ghouls, like start sucking your soul out. Like, it's like  The only light is like the artificial light of the computer screen, you know, is that little like Figures were talking like a Pokeball on the table at some guy, over in the fucking like this shit and die. Like he just needs to  Hittite, you knowing that the fucking like black everything. Cuz it's like I was thinking about you. I know, I know he's getting the line apart and he's fucking like eating them away, you know, literally like I know, I know, I know he said that you things up alive.  it's at and the thing is, is that like living with him, like I came like, when I arrive, I feel like suddenly, I feel like a like a  Like that was like.  Call Connie, who lives down the road from such as she's trans, and she just you know, I walk in the room is on just one time. We went walking with that. She's she's like really pretentious but she is from, she's from Brooklyn, but she's also like magical, you know, I didn't mean like just a very magical person. She's dropping. She's dropping out now to pick up the guitar, and she's on the plane and it's beautiful.  You know, she was just like she was fantastic, you know? And  I felt like,  What's his fucking name, Mark?  Who is the guy in the bar mat? I felt like a mass in comparison. I felt like fucking some, some, some offshoot of CMC, some some faceless some like some, like.  It was like, you know, she was beautiful.  I just don't feel beautiful. You know, I used to like you the what need to stuff thing about making oneself, like I didn't.  I always thought alike just by living, you know, just by being who I am, you know, the people around like the people around me would somehow like realize their own, you know, the poem structures and systems and everything that I'm around them. Like, like, I am a piece of art. You know, that I am like a provocative like that thing, you know, that costs that cost people out instead of that, like, the ordinary in to sort of into in into a wild of of whatever that I had that impact and not feeling that sort of like that. Impulse, some people around me, you know, but like gradually I've just been feeling that leaving me and I've been feeling myself more and more accepted, you know, anymore and most of integrated into these things. But at the same time, I just feel I don't. I feel like you know, before it was like, you know, the steps that I took, you know, it was like, you know, roses in like weeds and like moths would just like grow, you know, underneath my feet. So, you know, everywhere everywhere I stopped.  That's how I thought of like, you know, that's extremely narcissistic as well. But it's it was like I felt like a I felt like an ass, but I felt like I felt like this upset like, like I felt like I was channeling the absurdity, you know, like, I had some kind of connection to God and I was challenging this, I was channeling, enchantment thing, you know, just beyond, you know, I'm not like I had some kind of just my mere existence was just like a beautiful fucking thing. You know, I'm just like change the app and change the walls, you know, just just by my being, you know, and now I just I feeling myself like  In like mixed with a specialization and with a half-hour and whether I feel myself just being locked into a place in which sort of like might might.  my, it's like  My power is controlled and measured and directed, you know, in which soda Vine, I might be growing. You know, what time you're the fool like me, anything in the lab, you know, rather than serve like growing needs of the Wild.  the most limiting way to go about discovering new, like,  Who the fuck?  Reeves Wallace Stevens.  And then is meant to write a five-page reflection essay on it.  Three of them in a semester.  That's a death sentence and we got shit is an absolute. You write it if you want to you know, where you fucking sing a song. If you want to or you make a piece of art that you have a conversation about it or you just fucking going think for an hour or two on. It thing through these nails. That are the exact same format and the exact same parking lot. I'm not in this task over and over, that can be Quantified in my subject. Some of the fucking like, that's other thing. I'd like this. Like, in this reference of, like, objectivity and I say things that, like, you know, yours is like, no one to talk like, you know, what, it's like in some way, like whatever. I like. I'm trying to, like, fucking like poke the bear of conventional. Sometimes I go about it, like stupid or even hurtful ways, but it's just like,  And yeah, I know.  And it's deadening and it just it it.  That's why. I know the thing is, is that I agree. I agree sometimes but like, I was like the thing is going to linen pants. Like, I read a story book to I bring my power bowls instead of writing essays for him, you know, in like he like except that it's more. That it's a foster wildstyle really, that's crazy. I would love that love to read that.  I have like some, like drums in it. It's so fun. You know, but the thing is, is that like they do that because how it has been, you know, on how it always has been like in Spotify featuring me like right, which I think it should be in there. You have to upgrade its the goal of Education vs. Education. You don't talk to me grades, you know, if it's his knowledge like  I almost want to like,  I almost want to like start a school.  I love the way I love to hear about some of the things, but like it, I'd love to read like to quotes.  One is from a fallow at the very end of Othello.  David.  It's like really hard to get into it. Like when you start getting into it. You know, when you said when when when when you stop someone getting stuck on the language itself, if you start reaching sort of like it one lady when she's so it follows that the ladies best friend who gives. So it doesn't matter what the story is, you know, but she like said she was but she pass along some things that was so I ended up killing how they made an, you know, how you like the handmaiden for like a for this lady who ends up dying like the main Vietnam, Beatrice, whatever she's called. So come my soul to Bliss as I speak true. So speaking, as I think I laugh, I die.  So speak as Adeline got. So speaking, as I think I last.  Never speak as we think he and I know. But that's also like several other readings of this. You know, it's all just like Isis speaking. It looks like it, you know, it's like I think that I'm speaking, you know, and then there's also you know that that once  Once the waltz of the death of you, you know, and then the doors like and then there's also just lost a slip of my boy has it as the end approaches from memory the Roni w w w w taking out the place and mutilated W from other men those with Allen's left him by the hours in the centuries. Those are you know, that's our inheritance just a whole load of like mutilated wide. So, you know, I know and that's like what I've been doing for a very long time and I feel I feel like there is something grotesque about that, you know.  Create new tablets. There's any truth. It's like the old.  I wish I had thought through strength me. All my God.  If I can find it, the smoke.  It's called back.  Call Dad.  No, he said it's called.  Blue tablets here. Do I sit and wait old broken. So New Hartford and tablets whenever  They seem like real new chicken shit. No one tells me anything new. So I tell if my self mine Own Story. This is a wacka translation. I said, broken tablets in New Hartford and one no one tells me my story.  He's tied with me and they don't, you know.  I need more time in nature that because all we can do is just form new structures out of old Lego blocks.  Source. Yeah, I know. But the question is, is like, where is that source? And I'm wondering if you know, you know, Christianity believes that the source wasn't involved in the nature itself, you know that Jesus was a source, was 3 weeks ago for the different referendum, Amy. And all the alien on that, like, you know, everything else might flow for that River but I but nature isn't the ancestor, you know, our ancestor is the thing about nature, We have to share a common ancestors, but we are ultimately from a different route.  and like, I know but like,  I just want to let you know, we came back and was so happy to get back and I can go get back into society, you know, but the same time it was like I was Thoughtless and I was feeling this sort of like this sort of attempt to sort of make something out of nature. You know, that was my dreams, you know, and those things I was trying to make substantive substantiate my imagination out that, you know, to have like a few lines of poetry into my mind is all I wanted, you know, the fritz and naturally if he had the full me, you know, how to say, it looked upon the mountain. You know, that's all I want like Thing by myself for 20 minutes is exactly what they did. I like wrote a little thought. I just think we didn't give ourselves a chance. Do you know cuz we can I know. But the thing is, is that like even out there and I was just like, trying to build the 10th. I was trying to build the thing. I was trying to get the logs together and place the rocks to see the whatever and like, fucking do some upset. Like I should have said, I should have, I should have  Go on it. And like it instead. I just like, I was like just keeping myself busy as if I was like, as if it was like 2 months for me, you know, all of that. And I don't know what happened. I used to, I'd always walk like I, my family and I, we were walking out of work like a many, many steps behind, you know, so that I can be alone with my thoughts. Yeah, you know, you know. And  Fuck. Like. When I find myself again, it's like, it's like, I've been like inundating myself with, with, with like, people and things, and society, and tasks and and, and steps, and and objectivity objectivism, you know, and objects of desire and you know,  Todd's and all these different things, you know, I've been, I've stopped my life to the Limit with Furniture, you know, her with with sort of like a, you know, and it's all come with this sort of like,  discomfort this happiness, you know this the sort of like a thoughtless, you know anxiety on how you know, cuz everything is like is is  it's like you need to get yourself in order. You like slapping yourself to a 2d thing sucks that you can manifest yourself in the smallest of actions, you know, find something about you talking about Mark Cuban.  You know, Marxism never took the the proletariat treat Evolution for the doll comfort of capitalism.  And not kill myself.  Gas me how much I love it. Yeah. I know. The thing is that I know it's that because, yeah, I know because it's because like, I felt like, even with like,  That's why she's like living. She's like, you know, going into sort of like this at going into you don't like like saving the planet and my savings or the blending really just like throwing yourself, but I wanted like the biggest problems that is out that you know, and I also want to like taco one of these problems, you know, but like I almost feel like  I just become so selfish. I know I become so comfortable. I'm like it. I'm a bitch. Yes it and  if something's too uncomfortable, like I  I hate that, you know. And that's why I like I'm busy myself for like discomfit. You know, what? Like filling my life with meaningless little tasks. You know, that I just need to execute on. In order to sort of it is my mom. You know, she does the exact same thing, you know, you know, it is totally fucking unhappy but like because she's unhappy she feels like it even more talks and even more things that just to do in the one that's a sort of like your I like as almost like some kind of like Penance as some kind of sense of like, you know, don't be comfortable, don't be satisfied, you know, because you must whatever, does the same thing precisely like the old lady that like, tossed ultimate to walk, you know, when you're sitting. Like trying to manage this sort of Empire. It's like there's no like experience of action of fun, do whatever it just walk, you just walking at all these little achievable tasks.  Tell yourself, man. It's like like I had it wrong about Sisyphus. Fucking never always know cuz you looked back then like Looking Back Eyes. You can see, you can stop fucking rolling the Boulder and I have to walk back down, if off the fucking Mountain, you know, this isn't this the right? But he just keeps walking walking. He's like in the way that Simon walks, you know, but that's one foot in front of the other one for almost a hundred percent. I'm like, I feel myself becoming an extremely capable robots.  Diamond commands me for it.  You know, like somehow like somehow, like me becoming more appealing or more respected by Simon. Is it is like the biggest is the biggest insult.  I know one thing is that like on ultimately like it. I feel like it.  Like, it's like really, it's like, it's it's a nice thing for me to be with you call that because it's like it.  It's like you've been taking the different direction, you know, it's like it's like we've like swapped the rations almost. It's like I was like I'd like  Like a little bit. Like like you're like in pursuing the sort of  there's almost like a little, like  Like I want that freedom against like drawer and select make that little like thing. It's me to write that poem to like do that thing and it's sort of like, engaging sort of like, I don't know why when is going, but some of floating in to sort of like, you know, like a like a lot of I love that. I know you like, like a, I've seen you go towards like, like the all the places where my soul want to do I go, you know, I mean, like, I've been like, yeah, I know you like it, like, beautiful as I give, you got your, like, your fucking watering, and you've been walking on this God, and you've been planting the seeds. And it's like, the garden stockings bad like fruits and like delicious, whatever things and it's like fucking beautiful to see but it's like, I like was living in like a jungle, you know, and like now I'm like, you know, just call me back. I'm in like the cop. Yeah.  of course, you know, I was I was because I needed to sort of, like, make contact with the society, and now it's like, you know, now it's like I have this sort of like,  you know, I have I have  But I most likely lost, you know, it's like when I was in the same thing like that feeling of like that, where your Feet's white, why your feet touch the ground? Do you know, like moths and wildflowers grow, you know, it's like that. Like magical, sort of, like walk of all that is you, that is your life. You know, it's like, I stop. I'm starting to feel like sometimes when I walk, you know, it's like a bike cracks and crap, you know, instead of that the grass dies underneath my foot, you know, as as as I stopped, you know, that the flower was weather and I'm the things, whatever. Go.  And all the while while being like commanded by a lot of the people around me, you know, like, you know, becoming more like whatever and reaching some stability. And, and so did like you changed. Like, I can like tell there's something about your nature and your or that's more like, whatever. I don't feel better. Like I do feel bad that like I've been saying like, oh, I think the more I've been saying like, oh, I feel better than I ever have before. You know, I said that like a hundred times over the past couple months if, you know, you know, I don't think I do feel better than I did before, you know.  I do like,  Doctors way, you know, my wounds are healed, you know, in my, you know, I'm I my body objectively as like, you know, can walk, you know, and can you know, but it's time for me like, fucking pack up. It's time for me to pack up.  It wasn't a fruit as fucking stop you now. And you're like  I don't think you would be leaving with like the fucking people that you're leaving with any sort of like the the Vigor that is like reinvigorated events. Like I think you need a softball. So like it reconfirms that fundamental like fucking like I happy, I'm not comfortable in this world of like appearances and fucking just like, you know, like endless sort of Cycles to bullshit. You know. That's all that are inside and gives me it just it's it's it's like appearance and and bullshittin and disgusting that she would like hugging at the top of the mountain. I'm sorry, fucking push her off. You know what I mean? She was like, she, like, whatever. And she was like, what? And when he said that thing about, like, the portrait out. Yeah. I don't want the portrait view. Remember when she said that, you know, they didn't say that they can want to Portrait she  I don't know but she doesn't want a picture of Simon and huh. That's what she wants. You know, she wants a picture of like a landscape. It's like she didn't want a picture of her and Simon like that. Like she need that she said so, you know what that's not what I wants, you know, and it wasn't just  She wanted the fucking landscape photo. I don't know if she wants to like the look. I am like here in this place, you know, not, I am here with this person, you know, and this person is like a part of a contacts, you know, about this person is in the singularity like this passing. Like, I alternate lead, I don't care if I have a photo with if like, exactly, you know and see when do but then she was like, she said something else. Like the Simon is, it was like, she just like freaked me out. And then she like, she helped. She like she like she like it. How did Simon was like, you know what I mean? And she was like, then she was like hugging him and I'm just like, you know, like fucking like run away, but I just like I just wanted to like like I was just I was talking to have the store like just push him off the mountain, you know, I mean as in you  I've never been like, I've never felt so much.  I don't feel.  don't feel like,  Good.  I don't feel like just like I had like a long ass out of there. I didn't eat anything. I just I just had like a beer out like a misplaced. I sat down and talked to some guy called Tristan to study five year old guy from China. In September to scout. He like, ask me some questions. He wants me to have a baby with him tonight. You just gave me like that. Why should I stay at the Spirit Machu Picchu and stuff like that. It was whatever. But he's like a capital investor. You like some kind of like DC pasta in the spot like this.  Really?  You know, it's like the Hamptons in Colorado. That was just so, you know.  you know, in some way like this this Village makes this place and I love the fact that like it that we find the mountains with it for their minerals, you know, and the fact that like  I mean like it's just it's it's we built a playground and on top of that. I'm not supposed to like like it feels like oh you don't step off the path, you know, and I don't like whatever. I like me know all this, don't like walk this path experience this. Like a prefabricated little sort of like a picture after experience.  And I'm like, I don't like that at all.  I just don't know, like  I know I just love to hear about your dad's mission in education. That's just been on my mind all songs. You should you know the band wolf Alice.  They have this one song called Sing purple and green. It's like her talk to her grabbed. You even talked about this place. You called it. Probably fine. We got to find that fucking that purple and green for ourselves. And the path is like, it's like those Mountain. I think I remember like the sort of the first moment that I know, I tried not like life. Like, every decision in life is like, just got sucked up and it's his down in a million continue, have to keep walking on that leg, like, pleasing yourself like on the only like viable, like there's like one space for your foot to go and use can't be lonely at like honestly, right? Like this and like  That's like, I'm, like, way. I've opened up the Haley in the past, like four months in a way. I didn't think I ever would, you know, and my Dash isn't but the same time, it's like, it's like I feel like I've  It's like, I really want to, like, I think that's the reason why I like, you know, like, when you have like these famous, Ikes alkyls of office to something like that. That's a reason why they become famous together, you know, and it's not just that like each of the best ones found the other best ones and then made friends with them. You don't want to make a society of, you know, is that like there was some idea that you stop bouncing between them, you know, and that idea that bounced between them sort of like and everyone Chad and so does that light? You know, I'm not. Lights that initial set of like that conception that whatever. Just so I would like flowed through channels, you know, there are very few people who are like, you know, the wildest even the suit, just like those disappears and sent, you know, I'm just as like a solitary like kasel, you know, who just has that like that.  You know, of course, he had his own like this on fucking problems, you know, and I, I want, I want to find that Community. Like, help support. I like, you know, that pushes me to to write poetry. You know, that is not like daunting opposition to it. Somehow like Wallace Stevens in this family, you know, that. I feel like it's always been in opposition every single time. I've done any of these creative Endeavors, you know, like I'm like, I'm like struggling against something, you know, unless it's almost like sucks the life out of it before I can actually like it. I can actually do it. I want to find that like crazy of community that like to be in a fine. Be beautiful but also like selfish to, you know what I mean. In the sense in which like it can be like in any field for any but I want to like it doesn't have to be, you know, like, you know, that like piece of also, that piece of whatever I can just be sort of like a  Just like I got like, literally in anything.  Until I want to want to find that but I realized I liked and wanted to do that. I'm going to have to start like, you know, like I don't know like  I can like maintain my friendship with Simon in the way that live in like and like I don't know how would I would go about cuz the thing is he's going to like  I somehow like mean so much to him in in so many different ways, you know, and  I got like telling me, you know, that he makes me fear for the unwell.  like, icon icon like I I need  I need I need to like people who, you know, who I can like chat with things like great with you know, and who I can. If I don't feel like that. Don't feel like, you know, if I go out to show up supposed to Simon, you know, it'd be like  I like I like the I like the part where you told about the feet, you know, I'm just be like  just like all and I mean we talkin talkin to the math enough to decide for me. The only reason I'm doing it is because it's up there was like I see a magic in it, you know, but like everyone else I meet and that's the thing that I'm like, really scared about what this like. Yeah. I seen this magic but I don't see magic in any of the communities that practices, you know, which is why I like it. I want to take this, you know, to the artist, you know, I want to take this site to these different areas. I don't have it, you know, because in order to like, put it within and situated in a different Society, even if I misunderstood, then why why lying that? You know, cuz I'm trying to, I'm trying to find trying to find that Society like psychology, maybe it, but it's already like that but like, it's like in my tits, like him might be somewhere in the end and around that, you know what I mean?  This is the one thing that I've gotten from the Kania thing is like, the only, the, like that while these choices seem like fucking tariff, right? Like if you have this. And maybe make the world more beautiful, a click is a million. The only way to do it is just till I pick that up while he's like, you think I was making it like before, like, Jay-Z sign me, in the way. I started making beats for DayZ on my Beats. Fucking better cuz I was like surrounded by jet. You know, he's like that's the thing is like, you know what, Simon her signing this year that I'm just going to fucking like, give up and like if that means a little bit mean, you know, and if it means I have to sacrifice being around the room and if lettuce is in, what was my driving force for most of my life, like what was like nothing it was like being liked, you know what I mean? Like that was like the thing like I was bucking legs man, like like and if someone didn't like, it was like, top of my phone always like,  Jack or texting you this Jack, you know, the British guy.  Like I'm telling you know, and I fucking acknowledged it and whatever in this like five like fuk, you know that used to the end. It's for my mom. She gets depressed. That's all she can think about. Is I got everyone's going to think I like fucking and I'm just like  I do have love for him and I I fucking all after college, you know, I'll keep popping out because like we're not and you remember he cites, whatever that look at this big. I don't think it actually was a big growth thing for him cuz I see fucking no change, you know, but like whatever he says it may be shaking her. And as long as we continue to go out, it was like a bug that ever wants to like fucking look me in the eyes, you know and acknowledge me as like a person here and knowledge himself is then we can learn like yeah, I just had a hundred percent and I love that. It's just felt like  I mean, it's like I felt like  I just felt like something died within me when he said when we have a having the arguments, you know, know the door was the dreaming one, you know, and I just, it was like, in that, like, moment, it was like, I, I realized, you know, that like like this person does not see me and he doesn't really love me. And he, he, he, he, in fact, you know, he invite doesn't give a shit. What happens to me, like, you'd be happy for me. If I, if I got, if I got a job at Mackenzie, you know what I mean, you know.  And you would tell me, where are you? Yeah, cuz you did the tell me something that he wants because he's like never fucking owned up to his existence. Everything is 100%. He he he he hasn't acknowledged that all, you know, and hopefully hasn't acknowledged. He hasn't acknowledged the God. I know he means it's like he just  I asked and it was wise belief.  I just I just felt something died within me. I wouldn't want. He said that and if you want if he has to have an ostomy, you know, do you know that he feels that we've been said of growing Apostle, distancing, whatever, I'm going to tell him, like everything about that, you know about how I felt like  But the thing is, is that I know that I can say, if you want I can just fucking like she destroy him.  You don't make his life feel meaningless without like I could seize his life to be meaningless, you know.  Sounds like a rejection.  Or something. It's like almost like that. Like that's the level that like, I think you really just telling him how you feel. I think that's what it would do to him.  Is Aiken. Jessica just  Get shaken.  How am I supposed to just give him my gift given my like this, my artificial like this. And just have him communicates with it. And I've done this year for the interesting thing about this is that like I almost want like just communicate with with us, then have it just say everything.  Yeah.  You know how to say, I like for them to discover what my opinion is of them.  I mean if there be the announcement and then would be fucking great, could be a one February 2nd. If everyone knew everyone else thought of them.  Then we could actually get to the bottom of shit. We can felt like, you know, a lot of people, a lot of a lot of no trust. If this is like a worldwide phenomenon, if everyone just knew that a lot of people died was with be started, lot of lot of  Fucking brighter future When the Smoke Clears, I agree. I agree.  This world's full of detritus, man.  I just don't know, like, how I'm going to be, like, have to dinner tonight. You know, I'm thinking I'm like,  I just I just I just I couldn't, but the thing is, is I'm not good at that, not that kind of performance. You know, I mean,  I think you are.  I know, but no. Kind of performance. Not what I found when I have like a fund in the set of like just problem with someone.  Like you could you can you would like drag me with my like Teeth breaking in like the dots in the mud, you know, who just might. Like, I will, I will be biting down on the Rocks using my teeth to hold myself back, you know, like my fucking skull cracking before before before before before I before I can do those pleasantries, you know, like those plants and trees.

I just want to tell everyone exactly what I feel and I want to talk to them face and I want to just like I do I don't want I don't want to hold back.  Probably one day a week. That's just how I feel threatened. Entire day is like reality, just cracks in the cement and snapping, you know, myself. It's it's like the one, like, most the timer on Simon her Sunny like I can make fucking Pleasant feel like that day, when you know, whatever it is, you know, it's like you probably have been that day where he says something to me and it just like, it is like, the basic started, like a sponge and like, I think my coping mechanism is just, I just turned. And so I like, hold very much hold, like the opinion, of Aryan, like, us lunch. Like, I held that opinion of our inside, and close to see how they turn into like a little game. Did they? Did they say anything about did you guys say anything about me? So that will do is do.  X o. I just I just oh my God. Yeah, you do. When you have the strong feelings for someone like you can't really spare enough. Strong feelings about think I like impossible now. It's like, it's like there's a lack of calf. Everything in anything. You know, she might be in been totally different before.  You know, when they were together, who knows, you know?  but I  Would it take if I could I would ruin my friendship and Simon just a fucking take him by the shoulders and be like, snapping the fuck out of itself. Give you dumb fucking. I even though I know that he needs to do this. You know, it's like it's the lost that's like straw something that and let me know exactly like the last resort even, you know that  There was a a world with Simon for a long time where my decision hasn't been made. You know what I mean, but somewhere recently fucking made maybe was this trip for me. Honestly, think it was. But now, it's been an 8:00 and I can't turn, you know, there's no know how do you live in a world in which you decided you no longer want to be a part of it. You know, I know, I know it's you just got put in it hundred things that I just pissed me off me to me to the thing is the fact that like, we went by the Cyrus and all these things and there was no, it was like when we were together and I wasn't little bit from you sitting in that Cafe, you know, or when we were drinking, you know, that was like a few but like, most of the time with like, with you guys, it just like,  I felt like I was in the different place and I was a zombie. I wasn't dreaming of this place with you guys and I was don't like living. If I can't like I was not sort of like experiencing like, you know, history and life and myself and like your discuss self-discovery and like all these things.

I know, you know, it's unlike some people like, you know, like it's been really interesting is the hiking like what everything is dissipated. Big fight with him and have a great relationship with him. I wouldn't say great, but it was you guys had a relationship in freshman year that I didn't have with.  Yeah, why you friends with like Jack? Yo yo yo, yeah. I just wonder what you are.  if not, as long as it's not 11:00 Plainfield and he's just like he's going through some shit and he is just like 5, I think that's like the most  I feel the same way. I feel like I could be, I could be anyone.  I don't say, I think that's the big thing. Is that like, I don't feel like I have to give too much and, you know, I don't have to give him my house on the Plaza and I think I don't have to it's like, it's like, it's like so I'm barely hung out with him. This semester, you know, I mean, we talked back in the room. Sometimes, you know, we don't like do things together and that's fine. I don't really want to, you know, what is like not necessarily want to, you know, but it's just like, that's okay, you know, it doesn't have to like it because I think I think I think the problem is is that like because I'm roommates with him and I feel that him like sucking the life out of me in a little bit. So I'm like I feel that too. But just like, you know, someone who's had a kid is like, you know, that kid is like literally  I like, it could be absolutely terrible. I'm not sure if I'm going to be there for him with that, you know, if it is terrible and it seeming, like it might be open with, like, the small cat in the cat who, like, no one paid attention from Psych published at when they would like younger. And preschool know, that's just like a lots of that. Like a j is not the time and routes to Aiden Like Preschool and it's like, oh, I think you're really cool. Please. Come be. My friends type thing. I don't think AJ will end up because it's like, it's weird. You know what? I know, but it's a song about I don't like blames me for not like being friends, but what I mean to say, is that, like if he was like, this soft Beats beat back. Be back, be back. Be back.  Funnymike found something in like it, you know, I was some kind of, like, being a right mess. Really, fucking really talk with music and he just doesn't have the key guy. Just doesn't happen balls to do it. You know, you got to be, you know, and it's like, he only really he always would just like, you know, and so until they can called step out there when the states that have, like, let loose and open up his soul to people, you know, that shitt to the dog thing. I was on the not someone, I expect, I expect a lot phone. I just, I just, I just, I want, I want. I just I just I just wanted to be happy if you got any more coming.  Got to him. I see that like there is some kind of like getting in the way, you know, and he's just like a fucking kid. Do you know what I felt. You go in freshman year when he was in Washington. You what's up?  Inbox now, go for it.  Need to get off on speakers back cuz I'm like in his room. You know what I mean? He's like the friend. That wasn't, I think it was. I think it was. I think it's just you just like her that was his on-set.  I don't think that's it. Just a fling with him right now. And it's just like we go to like, it just like giving him like somebody got this is like a couple wise, a couple conversations mean  How much are they giving this? Yeah, you know, whether we like it or not. Like we don't really got like a, we would have liked found different communities it. That's fine. We'll just wait until they go away. Yeah, I can sweeten like they are out and watch out for swallowing the natural.  Nothing much we can do for a while. You might feel like he's like this cost on that, you know. Yet which one?  Like, we just started this. Oh my God.

And also like Simon understood that you didn't you didn't want him to Klingons. You mean to me. And then I like push them away a little bit ago. And now he's like, he's like understand sort of like a little bit about whether relation or where our relationship is. And so like nyman was was  You're my best friend called her. That you're going to, you know, what up, when they, you never even liked seeing the man. I like like the amount of emotional sort of like him, you know, I down paint.  Yeah, it's not, it's not possible to be true friends in the wedding. To me. I mean, his death, a relationship. I want the same and if they wanted the same, then that would be like a boring, you know, it ain't no relationship. The moms like a different, like a different set of considering, I've never had one, two, three of those groups, but the thing is that, like, the fact that you and Jackie Club, that's why I'm like, really just don't get that long, like, never have that whole inside of them, like, filled with like that cause worst moments in which we feel like totally just out of whack. And I'm not confident and so difficult. And I knew that because like I was, I was like, yes, I was like, I was like, but I did not feel like well, good for a very long time.  You know, you're crazy much, why sizing of me and it was like the love of a few just like made me about to pass and you know, it was like the love of a smell. It was, it was, it was.

I don't think that you would be about everywhere with me to my mom's now, and Mom Austin, right?  Me to the same thing for the same thing and that's why it's like, you know, we would do everything for them and it doesn't fucking math. You know what I mean?  I think.

His parents don't really know who accepted by Anthony note. He doesn't fit into anyone's life, is kind of like an even in his parents, you know, he's kind of like an all-day.  so it's like not to project into your life, because  Yeah, he doesn't know how to fit.

You would like walk into the room where I'm sitting and I know, but like a violin violin is one of those. Like, when you don't know how to play a song on violin, it just, it just possible that I can do on this number. So that's what's up because we're here for like a second.  Both.

But I think they're all like many forms of like success that sort of issue from the actual doing of good about the success rate is about the good. In the fact of the matter is that that the old lady likes dumb, fucking ideas of success in all this shit follow, right?

I got that B minus in that cost, you know, but like the question is, the question. I guess it's just like it just like trade-offs, right? Like identifying the point of where the actual distress is at the emanating, from right to have to do more with like social phenomena and sometimes I step, I don't know. I thought I just I think about the same time. I will have this other boys inside of me that's like that. Like is Talking Tom's episode of that like, is like this, so it has like separate. So it's like guilt voice. That's how, like, Dom I find this to be.

It's it seems like there are several there too like that. I think they're like, that's in danger with regard to. The cost is like that as well. Not just like a mental danger though, but there's also a sense of like in which if you opted Roar, you know, a line through history, you know, following One path of inquiry and thoughts. Go through.

They said you're not ready for.  So I can talk to about everything down. I know, no one's asking for it. But I'm sorry. I'm talking about emotionally.  Looks like what I feel like we are slaves to what I was saying. I'm not saying that you are trying to find anything. I'm just saying, emotionally should have did this this this, this massive discomfort with sort of like Society where it is and we're both about I just want to leave V8 distress. Ultimately. I feel like that's like the whole thing that society's been trying to do a lot of the time just at leading people.  Joshua.  Like, we should be the strange. Don't want you to feel bad.  No, that's not wasn't, that's not, that's not the part. That's not part of the butt.  That's the best way we can move, by the way up.  Yeah, I'd love to I'd love to take. Yeah.  I was thinking about, like, public option and like how like, unbelievable public office and I was thinking that whole kind of thinking about the guy about passing his belly.  And I always walk, that's the kind of joy that we need in the street. So, you know, like and how like Suburbia is like, literally the most horrible and destructive thing to exist ever because it's really just destroy. Its like, my my, you know, my private little like whatever that needs to be like in. Also like that, in my private thing was a fucked-up with only my mental thinking things that everyone has their own. Without them, in the washing machine. Everyone has their own, whatever, you know, it's like every, it's like it's like you're just creamed. His ridiculously inefficient system for thin or is that is why some of the distance that some people want to happen on this, you know,  Yeah.  Exactly. Yeah.  Did idolize that idolize that in society and me too? Me too. I want to I think it would be nice to have your own like room.  I also like honestly what that spoons is that so I can explain like slightly sort of like a create some of the conditions that that like that encourages lazing. It all goes to encourage Capital yacht yacht. This like this Reliant like this. Like this idea of the Suburban self-reliance and shit like that encourages people to, like, it want to buy things in order to sort of father to alleviate the burden on themselves to walk with. But instead, they replaced it with machine and I just like these luxury little humans that just walking around. You don't know how to reset for themselves, right? Because everything is taken care of for them. But the thing is, it's not like it, it's essential to be, everyone's got their hands in the soil, you know, a little bit your own times when it is like also without the expense of someone else's X loris.  Okay, your your building should have been a sort of like this is partly. The problem is the soda living among Stones times.

It's along the way, you know, and you were coming in. So yeah. Well that was for like if you look at my, my thing in Patagonia, you know, it was like horrible. It was like truly how horrible and I don't know if that's true. I think like living like a carbon-neutral in like walking on sodas like ways in which we can set up one hour like grow our own food instead of like integrate in instead of like it, it's one of the most important ones and Times of, I like corrupting overconsumption Andover, you know, all things, what other what other ones in the environment?  What do you mean by late-stage capitals?  Are you at the tragedy that exists all around us lost? So fucking much loan. The way the story started by someone making it up, you know, story started by the like listening to Nature and someone just having sort of like it. It's like I think because we do that because history wasn't wasn't corrected. When was like a tribute to, some of the great beyond. I do like it since I'm like it, you know, like lost States, you know, I'm not the thing is, it's not like, God becomes like that thing, right? And the quiet. You know, that like some lost God in some Lost Paradise, in which man was too.  Listen, which ones would you like some like just cool mint. Thank you so much.  Thank you for my. Thank you. Love you, too.  I love you. I'm going to, I'm going to hit that shit to hey, I love you. Yeah, that's why I like it. I guess. Like,  You know, we're like immensely gave him my love.

I think you also brothers from the system like quite a fucking lunch, you know.  And I feel like we we like it's like it's a different than that is disliked different racial component to it, you know.  But ultimately, it's a yeah, I mean, yeah, but while there are like seven other shit, right, that's what the South said about that slaves.  No, it's different. But it's that you can't deny that. I has all the say, all the same Houma. Yeah, I mean, but even thought of that while you're like the nice it. Cuz I mean, this was one of the biggest arguments in the South Tina was it is Amanda Anderson. Just the fact that like services and covered up by sort of like, you know ideas of like family and you know, that's what's up just domination base.  I don't want to buy something in the public.  Oh, yeah. That Homeless, you didn't you.  Play sneaking through things is Sousa, like marching truthful to acknowledge your purpose.  Like that's like the difference is in going in like to change your name in joining the reservation and picking up for vision impaired, as much as you can to bring joy from that, from that position, don't don't pretend because then you would reject me. Like, I'm not buying it just as much. That's all about you. Taking the kids to do the same.  Yeah.  I've got the Veggie Tales.  Call Emily Nathanson like huge Bakery in Grapevine.

You know, the God's thoughts like real strength. Do you know because that's dealing with it and dealing with difficult?  I think that's the big sort of like, struggle is sort of like how do I balance that if like  Like it's a whole thing about that.

And that's like Savas, you know, I know I'm not the best. We'll see what it, what is about liking finding the good. And when one is doing like it's by sort of like taking a pill Teri Kasam, like figuring out and if you ignore it,  Let's go to it.  All the week.  If one is to look at sort of like that.  I love your outfit.  It's like, you know how you told me cuz I think what I'm just trying to figure out so it's like the good good in everything. I see as well as outside that everything I see, you know, like capitalism is also like you know this be small businesses and stop her and I also started liking, I still have like widespread sort of like  It has a potent potential, has the potential within it, you know, to be sort of like an equitable, you know.  Way of sort of like a visual as a sort of us.  See, that's why I was just the benefit of putting you down being like let's just say I did try the loan and I didn't put like like I think it's like all of the other gets out of like what was before I mean Chiefs and and these things in which you know, that was that was so much, you know what I mean about? Like in that system. You didn't have a way out if you want to have a way if you  It's not why I do not believe it's why I was the sole reason why I'm not trying to defend it. And if and if I'm not trying to like maintain it, I think that's. So if it's more, that recognizing what it, what it can do. So that whatever system we dream up next can incorporate that within it, you know what I mean?  A little bit of like that wants to be good and also love to have this like you go about them. But like loves to like it is actually  It's like it's fine to have. And yes, it's cuz it's like men who recognize that power has a beautiful song a lot.  I'm looking for that before.  But I also just think that like, it's finding the finding the beauty and things like that. Even in the things that went that way, like been taught to hate like capitalism and love it.  I'm still sort of like integrate.  I don't know.  There is something to do, it sounds terrifying, but it's going to be fun.  It's going to be like, when the terrifying nature experiences just like it.  Hey.  Are, you know, and you can wash your hands and touch your clothes and wash your hands again?  Birthday.  Having fun.  I want to let you do it.  I think how fucked-up it started it. I think it's a crazy and it's it's it's because it's like I created the conditions for people saying to mingle of all different types and everything. It's allowed like people to get rid of some of those sort of like racially like a lot of stopping at least to move towards. Sort of like people should have asked the except like being accepting each other. You know, how many wars were related? But based on just yeah, just like we have to go to Pete. Those. The Italians, you know what I mean? Like, we have to go find clothes in the Staffing.  I like by creating the conditions for like a integrated, like a created, the conditions for something like a Merrick is looking for and I got some beautiful love him that I actually do as I hate it.

So the thing is that like we can use that as a proxy as well to look at soda.  Yeah, I like pivoted those columns. I just like rent-a-space segments. Wait. Yes, it is. Because if he, if you're using, I mean, see, you see it? Like sometimes I hear maybe it's in one of these people. If you'll like the same name calling names, you want to be able to know which one that coming.  But awesome anime. That's interesting. What's the sub ratio of the opposite likely to use subtitles? And then you can see this is almost as well as when you go down to the last one, the subtitle meet us. There, a metric us on this tastes a segment. Okay, let's look like  Look at the actual point of all these for that. That'd be really useful, so that it is as /, / 0. So, and I'm disabled. Okay? This probably about a Waitin to figure that out. So we actually got the subtitle thing and how do you name a number?  It was right. Not make sense, looks fantastic. If we just go through and do all of these all these things that we can like really like take a look at all the results and stocks. Like looking in that shed so I can just continue doing this shit.  Resend it.  I was terrible.  Yeah.  The reason we were going was because my roommate was going to go see his girlfriend. Who's out that for 33 months. No, no, no, no, no. No. It was it was it was a Saint Simon.  No.  I mean, it's and the thing is that I was always kind of opposed to it because it was like, yeah, the cement feel like we were roommates in a freshman year and my roommate's now, man. It's so like was meant to be sort of like a mini Simon and calda going to get. Yeah. I'm going to go and, you know, and so call her. And I were going to go for like, 4 days of it and just go hot to go backpacking, bazaars and stuff. But like, Simon the whole time he just like ditched us all the time and it was like, you know what the airport you know, when is tickets 11? The walking in the covid tests weren't coming through or something like that, miss my flight and left. You know, I just got on the flight and then we made it through but like I said, it's like it's always thought it wasn't like for us, you know, it was just his like thing his way of some of weaseling it out since I combine the two trips, you know, when she was kind of like she kind of like cheated and like everything sort of exploded and they  And then everything in the middle of what and he went catatonic but like and we have to like stop off for a day and chat like tripping about to go Nia because like the tent that we rented, wouldn't walk right hand Patagonia is like, you know, it's like minus at nights and then like 86 during the day, you know, and is this the weather just goes like fucking crazy and the wind with 80 mph and it was raining and snowing. And the thing is that the content and clothes and so every we just were flooded with water like every night, and I got bit by like a spy, do something like that animal. And my hand swelled up to double its fucken size, you know, and so I was like, no fucking sleep, no fucking anything. And like we had both with books and I keep up with the chest that we can. We play chess out like a mountain top.  Who does a shivering in the desperately? Ridiculously Wendy constantly. It was on The Winning Side, like, tropical storm levels of wind. Yeah, and so it was just, we came back, just like shivering in like a pain, like Daddy, you know, all of our food. We got drenched through so we have no fucking food. We have like, backpacks, like six seven hours, like, like in the morning after having not season for like, you know, like 12 hours, you know, before. And so, we haven't eaten for a day and oh my God, it was we came back to them just broken off and everything exploded. And then we just like fuck it just it just went and Cena and the shit just went bad cuz you can yeah, it was it was just  It was just fucking it was just fucking wild. Yeah, everyone everything. Just go to a hiking trip was just like, backpacking, just 11 terrible. Yeah, but it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's okay. It's okay to come back. It was like three fucking red-eye flights. And so I got like, you know, the whole trip probably less than 24 hours of sleep and it just locked their Dreadful. Yeah, absolutely.  That's always always fucking girlfriend drama.  Balance, balance your ethical Compass, you know, kind of him, if you know what I mean. I feel like it but like, I, I think they want they wasn't ready.  They're getting a 69, you want it?  Yeah, I can make boys and beautiful look like  Max.  This is your chance to see had more like one more. Something that Mike was Turkey, was curious. What her pro at least in this subset. At least amount of shows to watch it. Every time something was watched. I think that dad like those difference would have conceptions of what I meant for something to be watched or something to be streamed. It was longer than it was.  Just to say that we were looking at in the state of set the most, at some shows me. What are the first? What are the first? What's the. Of time we looking? Do you know that yet? That's a passing era. Probably something about the most I'm trying languages or billete switches. Currents of watching a language. That was that was that these like, I think it was like part of this, the conversion is not your writing son of optimized. Yeah, it so, I don't know if we can like give this to them because they just be like  What the fuck is going on? Oh, yeah, a hundred percent, but not kisses better than just provide the Anna and so  There is, there's a, there's a package called DB sequel, something, whatever it. Allow. It allows you to query SQL using a lot simpler. I think I have it loaded in at the top here. Maybe we can collaborate and I see how it you can say it and see her standing. Okay. Yeah. Just do like sequel in. Are we won't be using SQL particular. Is it the same? Mostly everything's the same except I think of my break because we'll be using PC quote and not see polite.  One of them's just better for large amounts of data and they, and they do a lot of the newest, some different things, but said it would be wonderful. If you could just like one of the big things, I think that we need to do as a that's like, very cool since this would have liked. See, so to get us immediately important is that to get those business dates? And so taking a look at the raw file or just printing out. The head will let you know the Fest.  I took like Prince. Let's just to create a new coach Unk. Yeah. Just we can just do it in our here. We'll just do like in that 10 mil. I should watch.  I spoke to 19 through sequel.  Papa's.  And cool, so pretty much what we'll do is that we'll just do a select from then we'll just lemon.  10.  Okay, you look that's busy State, don't quite understand. Let's look at the code book.  He's like a specific, probably look so we just got a date of Engagement in formats.  How can I take a look at it? Really?  Visit a team that seems really weird cuz that's something that we can ask them about because it be 7:00 at the end but could also decide could be the dish cut out. They cut out all the zeros. That would be an 18 84.  and,  I was thinking thinking 18 and I'd be in but then like 80.  I think it was I think I think it was I think it was so like when it was reading as a file and it was reading all of the CSV and see it, whatever it like assumed that it was like a double or something like that. And then took the and then just reformatted. It was something we should look at. We should look at the raw data.  Directions. But you can see  Pilot list of questions for Digicel like, a beautiful and the festival. The this is also a passing era. It has this this isn't necessarily for Destiny. This is something that's wrong with. So it off. Let me just do like that to end the SQL query.  So I can select program type count as an from 10 mil Group by program type. So you just  yeah, that's weird.  But why what's up, what's wrong with this? So it it's too soft correctly. So because all of this, all of the tea, so the only thing separating that from that from that, not mean from all of these different things and I just call them is right, and that's a common missing somewhere. It wouldn't start reading the other row as we should take a look at the data for that. It might be a problem in the day 7 of might not. So we can have to like open up the data itself.  But these most likely have problems that we have to deal with no problems that they can fix e.  String in there. So nobody know, B, probably with those numbers. Don't make, don't make sense. Yeah, they want like one instance of the show, be right. That should be multiple. I'd like no show. No show. But it was. It did the other person. Yeah, right. Like we should not use that data because it would it's going to it's going to be fucked up. And so we should, we should we should take a look at  That's fine. Honestly right now in DC go Cruise needs to be like those can be generated and we can we can fix. We can fix all the right. Now. The the main thing to be doing we need to get done. Is that Daniel? Daniel? How you doing? Have you walked it all script?  Okay, awesome. If you get if you stopped, if you just create an Oscar up, that will do the whole logistic regression like this, the simple one. No, I didn't call him is just walking on the encoding and all that shit like that. Seeing what you can do and cracking about them than we should be golden. Umbrella, do the map produced cross-eyed this this weekend or whenever I have the chance. I'm going to a rave tomorrow. So the queries, we just want to  Like I was thinking about for the final presentation at, we can do that. The split, the split that makes sense to me is that you know, we're going to have like many slides. Just this is what they said. Looks like. These are all the different things. You know, these are  Got my even just getting started walking. Like, once you get to a good spot with the with the SQL queries just like getting a final project template. Like the actual presentation. I'm like starting on that cuz like I feel like we can finish like the whole project in the next like 2 or 3 weeks and then we don't have to be an immensely helpful hundred percent. We can even like have a final presentation like complete and then we all we have to do is like practice it, you know, and do all these things, and then we can get it out of the fucking way. So we do, it doesn't stay with the other classes. That sounds good. Okay, so in terms of timeline,  In terms of timeline, let's Maybe.  Got the generation tables doesn't doesn't really make any sense so far cuz you don't have the full screen. So just building out the sequel Curry's and getting a final presentation template.  Airline Packages, yeah, really. That would that would be beautiful and if you just keep them walking on these the sequel Curry's week cuz we're going to need to start getting not just of the overview ones, but it was supposed to have, like, thinking about what Collins we want to add. It would be interesting to try to understand English at weaning specific tape, which type of content, or what kind of cheese are you singing? Those things are going to be really fucking fantastic. We need to be nice. Like, I understand all of those things in order to build out the tables cuz we all feel like part of our thing is to is to sort of like the data visualization, the date of his PlayStation and all those things, but then there's also the the component of adding things that the logistic regression will find useful. So the thing is about like stuff about like the taste  Edmonton things. I got. Something not that all can into it, but that's something not that the logistic regression can into it already by looking at Old to call them. So, it will. Realize, I do, you know, takes place. This size is a segment is highly correlated with this subtitle language preference. To those things on, are more useful for the actual visualization, understanding the data, then it is necessary for the logistic regression. Logistic regression is about to do. We need, we need like all them. That will actually help with his two crashes, regression determine.  Yes, the problem is that we don't really know yet because we need that data sat. That's going to walk with the. It's like we going to, we want to be able to us.  Continuing needs to go. We'll get the day to start running. I will get that will get that thing running. The mapreduce process. Got the dataset, do logistic regression. Make sure it works. And then we can fasting the different queries because there's no point in like adding the queries from Southern Cleary's. If it already does, a really good job on the standing mean,  Catcher. Throwing a, I mean, just the the, the site, I think of a 22 or something 24. It seems that we have 2024, different. Different fact, is we have more than that though because one hot, and Coatings again, that we going to need that in order to generate the fee chat Matrix, for instance.  We're going to need to have the one about encoding princess for the language tag is that there's going to be you know, if that was 53 different like languages or whatever included 16 different languages that are included. Then you going to have to have like 60 different zeros, themselves into these encoding. So each observation will represent one row in this Lodge encoding featured basil, set rights, and what you'll have what we need to not something that we can do some research or so.  The first thing to do, just make a very, very simple simple feature. Matrix include two different at two of the different columns. So we'll just stop by seeing if it walks with the in, which you only lest the program, type or the program, titled, the language, chosen the playback language for instance. And then that just dude left, we can just do a logistic regression on that fast, is that make sense. So that's what he was supposed to write it on the board. So what we're going to need to if you just search up like how to  How to create 10in coatings on a on a day to set it up and figure it out and then you can also do another one. If you complete do another walk in the encoding of adding a couple more of the features in  Yeah, he's going to need help with, then couldn't. Because the thing is, I do. I am the one, the one hunting Coatings chat either but like it's it's probably some shit. You can just land of a thousand some guys in line. So I'll figure that out.  Yeah. So before we do the date question before, the meeting just an action items that we have to look at the rules CSV and see what it looks like in the CSV. So just open up the CSV. See if it like is the date in correct format in the CSA. Just like open up. Yeah, I can also do that on the lamp.  I can also do the thing that we have to just a little action item if you can like ride ride to down, is  See what we can, even just we can do that. Now. It's the one that's been open the 10, mL. I can also just check it on the lam 27 right now, shs.  But it's yeah, I can do it easier in the in the command line on the land to 7.  I'll push it to the gifts.  Ctrl + 10 mil.  Sample. CS had Academy just like I'm want like interest equal to understand Disney plus server service things that are going to be like somewhat like informative friendly anyting.  Just if you think it's interesting, just just write it and see.  Okay.  The dates are fine. It's just been.  It's all luck. That's what the date. Look Who's Talking?  Yeah. Spot that's been the passing of it. That's a fantastic thing to figure out if you can, like figure out how correct play, how to do whatever so that the and then write those queries to see. So there's like, okay when the day to start when it starts where Aunt when it ends that would be beautiful, but it's not an obligate since equal rights being loaded in this equal. So something  This person is date like this. It started like this.  Yeah, the next time. It's definitely look at units format made it since you don't have time to last since the day.  Maybe it's not.  Okay, sick.  That all of that, all the files. I just organized that thing, so it should walk will do.  Yeah, it's it's a long fucking scrap. That's the right. Okay. Yeah.  Yeah, so this is like yeah, I'm at we'll see, we'll see how it works. If it works. So what the thing is about like it's it's also good worst case. If we like, front-load love this watch. We can actually got, we can actually might can actually help cuz he won't feel like Radisson in that. She said of giving us, we can be like look at whatever shit we produce and then he can fix it. And then it's so much easier. The exactly was it supposed to give it a shot and see how low.  just,  Is that for tomorrow?  So out to the Hundred Days thing did not like I'm never going to go to another event. Again is the first one I've gone to and it was just it was just such an ass man. I was I just yeah the thing is I went out to smoke a cigarette I couldn't get back up. And so yeah, and so I ended up just walking around like downtown and just talkin to random security guards. Be much. Yeah.  Do do Ismael. It wasn't? Yeah, it was it was a lot. It was it was a lot but then I just and then I came back and shit just started going down. And I started seeing just like the detritus of all of this of our class just like tossed out into the street and just all the vomit, you know, I got like to go phone and all of my shoes cuz I like just fucking take like three drinks and chill out. You know, like what is the gross?  We say.  Is our emails about that. I'll let you know about that. I haven't checked at. Did you have to take this evening?  Okay.  12.  They think they know what we've done and we'll have when my while you're walking through some of the day. So just see if she has any questions come up and write them down, everyone. It would be good. If everyone just brought like one question, even if it was just if you figure out the dates yet and figure out the times between those things. I'd be beautiful bring even just a bulshit question. Same question about about like, I feel like everyone brings one question. We should be chilled something. Even if it's just about Disney or it's about the costing them about that job or some shit like that, you know,  yeah, yeah, if we if we have it at like make make like meeting notes just so we can walk through something and just we can say we should we take  I know I've just been staying at Sandra's birthday to. It was on a Tuesday.  Yeah, I lost my fucking phone somewhere in the room. That ain't came in early today. I was like, why is this phone has love that.  How about you is good.  Oh, both days.  Accordion.  How fat I was putting myself in bed.  Other news. Job. That's fantastic. What y'all doing?  They send you an offer or something. Is it? Congratulations?  Yeah, but seem like a really rough fucking process job.  Yeah, I mean, that's the whole that's what a joke. I mean thing is most skills of people have. Unless it's like a very specific kind of scale. This is like a coding. All I got whatever almost you never actually end up using them as much. Most of your most of what you're probably going to do is just like, just like random like shit walking hymel's. That's like what most jobs are like one cool thing, but like most of it most of it's just, it's just like emails and just bullshit.  Good. Yeah, I agree with that. I think I think people should get paid for that time. But then again it's also like that would also make it to that like people decide to live father. Like we have a lot that was opportunity getting in Floyd know. But it would mean that like most most jobs are scented most offensive in the middle of the city and so like only rich people would be, would have thought Bethel.  Yeah, I know. But unless they've got that, that is pastina with what whatever. Like yeah.  That's good.  Congrats santastic.  It's going to be Seattle, you know, Ari work things out.  Are you still in break?  by the way, it's a really good to have explicit conversation about  What it means to be on a break or not. It's like really important because and are you guys open?  Okay.  Things are looking up.  Black panther fight ever since it is like, yeah. I know who's wearing it every day.  Oh, yeah, I'm going to I'm going to I should go to that too. I just saw him.  One sec. Let me see.  Hey, son, what's up?  Oh, yeah, I'm going to go. I just met this guy. Just, I just saw him at leader. He was a friend from from the freshman year, and he just he's putting on the documentary that he's been walking.  Yeah, I know. This is. Yeah, this is that guy. He's great. We, we used to hang out a little bit and so,  with a  Really?  You got me there, free food to Canes. I'm yeah, you should come. I was thinking of coming for like a for some it's a 30 minute documentary. So I don't think it's at but you have to, I can also see if I can. You can also just eat that mushroom pizza and got to walk in your shed. I just thought I saw him cuz I want some of the fountain for a meeting and he was just like, oh, yeah, of course, I'm coming, you know.  Really Kate, you should drink all the. I guess that's all. She's man.  How you feeling? Are you feeling better?  Okay, I'll see you later in the library then or at your place. That's probably going to be in today. I'm going to start or sit in the back and my computer to walk a little bit but  yeah, so  okay. Yeah, I just left it like that and then we can meet up. We can also walk to your place. I will find a different place to walk later on. Ya precisely.  Hyundai's is my last.  No way. I'm fucking getting on the bus with CNC is again. I'm going to write tomorrow, so  I woke up Pikmin. Is that the one?  Listen.  Metal piece in the back like a great that I have my phone now.  Cool.  I'm on the white spots. My thesis shit. Now know it's late.  No, so what I'm doing is I'm going through everything. I'm going through, like I have to go through like, you know, I probably have to get like 20 hours or do you just listen to it and cut it up? This is when I'm speaking, this is when it's silence. This is when someone else's speaking. This is when silence and the thing is that conversation, feel like I have to split it up. So fucking much. It's really fucking rough.  What's?  Personal identity.  Sprouts.  Wait, so you can bring people.  This voice is s o. I mean about this wink wink, you know what I mean?  Most annoying with the most legendary.  I think we'll be good. He's a good filmmaker. So  be great. I hope you're  yeah.  Yeah, I know who is the grills and shit?  Yes, exactly. The big brown stomach.  How many monitors Michigan from Lake? Enter for like a fool. You do one email on each monitor?  Russian army gun.  Go down.  Have you been with you to spring break?  Is he an oil guy?  Drive to Davis then off to its oil rigs. What? What brought your dad today?  Is Simon Simon assigning coming?  Arsenal Mall.  We are going to be fun. Great filmmakers.  A Havanese.  No, Game, No fucking clip. Nice, but I'm just a man.  I like app.  Not one used to like like knowing of me but like Alyssa watch.  Greatmats.  Yeah, famous not cool, man, like things that can make you Infamous, you know what I mean? But right now, we'll see about that and just throw up my hands and then went to showings and just in case it's going around the aisles selling Rotten Tomatoes.  Apothic reason, you know you want to show you want to sound like I'm bitching roll sense of like you put me through this, you know, some people got to get that feeling Taco Time.  But then you have to clean it up. I been making myself for a while. Now. I'm building a small, particle metrics and stuff like that. And also like make a eyes. That's a recreate my speech. And so, you can, like, talk with yourself and instead of got down to. So does the house of thing, I'm training, a bunch of machine learning chat. Now, the sword. It was so through it, train some models and see what kinds of things I can find. Some of John Willingham times meaner to the Pirates tremendously Rotten Tomatoes to me.  I'll see you inside.  Let's go find a place and back. ",5226,03/24/22,220324_004_me.wav

I'm reading the viewing like looking at the other way. But it's like he's not it wasn't so well at all, but it cuz his dad walked in like an oil in an oil rig. I'd like a walk on the way already and I was talking to all these people and everything. I thought and I need like the books that have like a fiction about set of this like throw rag type thing.

Run for me to where is going to be. So fucking fun with me. I have to order.  You should.  s u b u  Hey sunshine. Do you want me to do? We should regardless of whether you know, of know, if you going to go to a program or not? We should order just the tickets to dolly or wherever we're going to fly into and then we can just get that's going to be the expensive one that's going to go up in price and we can figure out all the rest.  I know but like what if what if you want to like, if it for instance, if you are going to go to the Jaipur, you going to want to like, you know, for the program that would change.  Okay.  We can do that, right? That's why it makes sense, but I didn't want to be with you and then deal for like the whole of it we can we can like make a whole leg. But I feel like if we're that for like a long enough time, we'll be able to a compliment as a little better.  Play the best food culture.  What?  Oh my God, I would kill that.  I know.

Let's go get me to the phone. Is that if you do an hour of what I feel like will feel justified in going home and not doing any thoughts and now we'll still be stressed. Walk Vibes at your house. Cuz the thing is that when we stay here for an hour and we've done this before and go back, you know that we just feel justified in like don't do any walk. Have a cold brew. I need a fucking cold brew.  Okay, my thing is that we go to your house then we know each other accountable.  Yeah.  100%. Go to you. Go to that guy. Take the bed. I love the badass.

Can you walk away? And everyone's like sometimes got really angry at him for giving me a message and he was laughing.  Yeah, and I got I got like the entire thing became like locked into missed because of that because everything was kind of like hazy and the spots with flying off and so do you know, do you know? I mean, I was like kind of a little drunken something. Casting.  Precisely.  But it's, it's like totally different stuff with people during the wine season.  Yeah.  I know.

I know that, you know, how much the biggest, like, the biggest fucking license in my life will drink cold brew at the same time, you know about, like spending enough time. We were young that like it. I like habits. As we got into. What have we got into it. Whatever. I like the things that we like. I'm breaks the things that we can do. They also have like no, I absolutely adore the cuddling.  No, it wasn't of the cuddling was bad. It was that we go and cuddle in your basement off to school and then you'd fall asleep on me.  Why was I got so? It's not like it was like, okay times was too cute cuz I was, I was like, why is she sleeping all the time? Just a pot for like all of my girlfriends. For some reason, it the partly because my partly because I was like, my like friends who went to my friend's withdrawals, you know, when I was with Sophia was friends, you know, and because I didn't ya,  yes, I was like  No, no, no friends. And so they would always be like, my friends. My girlfriend's Vivian and her friends know they would like Caroline.  Yeah, hundred percent but unlike the Sophia's and whatever. We're more like more like Eliza Euphoria Vibes. So it sounds like perceived as sort of like  Bitch bitches site. Lease actual  So this is kind of yes, I actually went is nothing is not insane.  That was, that's insane to me. She seems like  Yeah, I mean against those smiles were nice and well, I was really stupid. And the thing was that they would like very much. Thank you for your Vibes. And I was like this. I know I D.  Yeah, sort of it.  Yeah, I'm like, I think one of the biggest things that like, would like Sofia grappled with was, if I felt like I made a few dollars that I couldn't help it, you know, cuz if I could go to miss. I think the different but she was like, it was almost like  The reason the reason why I like those cuz she was at she was outside of everything and she was Unapologetic.  And like I like confidence in the face of like all the bullshit. That she created for us off material and the bullshit that like other people through extreme full witness was like I don't even like choose her. So I made a decision at any point. That's the thing. She just going to start steamrolled me and just like that. You are my boyfriend. Now type thing, you know, and that was it that was like the end of the discussion. I don't know if she likes my smartness. It she like she stole that. I have blisters on my fingers and she was like musician.  I know this person. I didn't talk to this person. Just off the classic. She woke up to me and was like, you want to go to the ice cream? Ice cream. Whatever. Let's go. Let's go like hang out like a my face type thing.  when was the box-like happened and then when I stopped and decisions for myself cuz I was like an extremely aggressive, an extremely abusive in the end like in until when I started getting like I was like, oh, yeah, and it's not even like the things people like everyone was the same, like, always, because she was just like Mater, it's like a sexual object, you know, probably, cuz she made it sound like, I don't know how to really like reconcile that because  Everyone whatever. It's like all you like him because of sex or whatever. It was. She doesn't haha because like I like it, like shit had uterus was like locked up.  Yeah, yes. I want it wasn't even like that. That's that's that's what I  that's so funny. What did he say?  Violent, obviously, if he was a dumb boy.  Packing list, but it's pretty badass music.  Yeah, of course.  It's always French.  So, so just have happened.  She wants, right.  Yeah.  Masturbate, but like question is like when we used to fight it like you got really hot me out.  That's true.  Okay.  Right. Yeah. Maya.  Yeah, I know what she's like in 10th Grade now has Gary.  You know, I don't really like, silly just got to 100%.  Hang out here. Yeah, he did really like that one.  That's cuz he really really really respect trauma.  I think that they would be Puff.  Oh my God.  You're supposed to just like is great because like it's so interconnected the family. Yeah, he's actually  Looked, why really?  That's funny. That's really funny.  Yeah, but it's, it's interesting.  Yeah, but it was ultimately like also like extremely little kid because it was like entirely based on. So there's like a bunch before you got but I think like it was like it was still extremely like that, who can write. Because it was like,  already pretty cuz it was like  I wasn't a real conversation at all, you know about like it was all just tiny thing. I would like a shine. Whatever. It's like shiny in this course, you know, like a concept thing that like she really wanted to go to and I was like, I like I was just saying okay whole time, you know, and then when I saw his like a site like what what I wanted it was like, it was clear. It stops instead of becoming evidently clear. That what I wanted was a heads up when she got really, she just got really sad cuz I was like, I don't know if I was reflecting so much pain like how am I was? Well, liked my expressions of the things I really liked.  Impacted her because I know who I wasn't really necessarily like thinking about like it was like, oh wait and then like we are going to get married. We're going to like, yeah, so I think she was thinking too. I think it was like, oh this is like a, you know what? I mean? I'm not like in the breaking point was on a tutu, top of the ACT.  She got angry.  Yeah, I know but that's what it was. Is that like, ultimately like it when I actually saw she was just like, no I see strong at all. She was just extremely like fear-based. I was like, you know, everything was insecurities. You know, I'm not like all to mately like high like conference with high. Like, you know, I presentation and how like lack of calf will people thought it was just like an will also just outside like in secured like she she was she was always trying like makeup for like some lock that she perceived that she had, you know, not necessarily in times of like just like intelligence for say the light just lacking tones of  It was like, yeah, I don't really know. It was just like I really realize that she should be going to like all of us and sees and all if I liked it images, know how like a constant Center performance of South just started like disappeared and then I started seeing someone else. I know just like this in the past and I'm with her and it's sort of like when she had lost the confidence to see. Also that was like the thing that was a cool, but I was that she was like a continents and Unapologetic and I really like that because it was like especially especially in Sky Zone with a lot of people like that. Like fake and like only caring about sooner, you know, that future is in like that in a very specific way and it was like she didn't care about any of that. She was just fine and just should have like head on the walls kind of, you know, and it was like, oh, that's cool.  But yeah, but I was just as she was rejected.  I love to see them.  How do you feel now that you are 21, you know, I've been holding a secret for like forever because it was kind of like, I never wanted to say it because it kind of like I felt like if I had set it all the way I would have taken away. So the view thing.  Her favorite color was Papa and I don't want to say it before. Yeah.  Can I see you have to show me. Can I see? Can I see? Can I see?  I know. Why don't you want to text?

I think it was telling around, you know, I guess doing a lot.  Factors that she looks like terrific, a mean.  What's ICBM make you uncomfortable?  Nobody looked hot. I think she blocked me or she blocked me a long time ago. She still hates me, but the passion.  Really?  Yeah.  I think I think the other fucked-up thing was at like she likes me on like drugs and you know music, you know, I mean she like yeah, she like didn't like the size of me that would like  I really like, you know, yeah, and like everything went got to that until I Keno books and culture and everything.  Thing. Is that like, that was like the wall that she like.  yeah, you know she put it down not because of any other reason other than she didn't like to read, you know, and the thing is that like  Looks like the person you got like, you know, how is like stupid oppressive and crazy and everything like that. So it's not like you like that, you know, exactly what she likes like. Crazy shit, you know, shouldn't like  Yeah, she said she didn't like anything. That was like.

I'm going to laugh and we're going to be like, I don't want to drive how to kill it. And sorry I got pansies.  Yeah, yeah, inscription, what about this table? Because it's underneath the. Do you ever see people here?  I know this is really love.  When this walking distance to me.  Yeah, but mine's me like a suit height, super lightweight.  The point is to not anyway, do you care if I look ugly for a second? If I just know, I mean like what you'll see. I just want out of my eyes.  It's kind of a sad.  I'm sorry, if I look. But I feel like my heart is so really. She was. So I'm telling out of that. I've been having a everything about that. I mean that as I got dismissal of your feet I love and I don't have any less creative act like you inspire and like no way much more than anything else. Are you feeling even feeling bad? I would really love that. We have a lot of fucking commitment and that was like spring break and see, how do I spring break now? I really wish. I'd like to talk to the phone and so much fucking fault that I just passed something out.  Like I came back from lunch and Tina just feel like wise thing worse than a hundred is my faint, you know, running in the bosk, but it was just it was I was in it because I just felt I felt that before in Las Vegas, remember, and it was just like Vegas and then this it's like this is not just like a bad experience, isn't how things I I don't feel so called Lesotho.  and I very much season, feel the same time there is  Weather like in Henderson. I like, you know, like  putting my shoulder. It's still like burning out classes with like a good feeling. I feel like, what what is between us is just pretty shop. Cultural difference to him, actually, sort of retaining and Tobago to fight other people. I don't have to speak about with a deposit. Like, I, I love my relationship, the night or is it just something like, and he's gone, you know, no clue. She just text, and she only until what time. Yeah, I think she is. Simon, Gilbert said and called us. That is. Why do you think you seem like fun? What she wants is?  Creation in South manifestation of you wrap presents instead of like a positive, sort of like a lot of the things that you could do in like walk to will do mine, and she desperately wants to do with Simon is trenches and so it's like I'm like, doing well, I'm on I'm like out and she's like, you know, I mean, really  I guess I should he's trying to surround she's like going through I like rough. Instead of like trying to surround themselves then not just you know, stay instead of being in the valley of her, the volumes and just groveling them instead of God and like and like, fuck with that. Me and beeping like a positive directive, whatever like a bombastic slightly for 2 hours of played out of place in this a saying and it's almost like, I don't know. You show us all so it sucks because then AJ hangs out with him all the time. It a day only has about looking good. Father people.  Separates Me from the age of eight. Don't believe his intentions are good. Always, you know where. So I can send to your question. Is that your way she did and things like, I also feel bad. I understand that I'm with you, and I'm not like busting at the seams to go. I just want to, I just want to like the Most Wonderful class and then you make me, who might be fucking honest with you. I have not because I feel like I can choose me and that's how all these people who I wish I could you about yours are amazing and you shouldn't, you shouldn't feel back. And yeah, and I just I feel like I like the Grateful Community. Hoping, I want to hear of him and I can't stand that cuz I really don't even just connecting cuz I know you were crying when covid happened, you know, about being back together, doing things here and stuff the whole time. It's like, your friends. My friends were all hanging out and I came back to just, like, everything being Splendid and nothing, really like the chances and possibilities and things, you know, that could have happened just as old specs.  And it's like there's no saving it. Now, you know what that leave me in my friends will beat, you know, they'll just be like  I'll just flosser into the walls and on Stenton and so like this is on my mind because it just seemed like you from friends from. And I just I don't feel like I'm  Feel like I just made a lot of bad decisions.  Choosing teams. I was like over. I didn't like Refugee walk and stuff. And then that was like, kind of kind of broken when I went to Jordan. And then that was like the thing that was reason for going. So don't just got kind of what I'm not just out. Either made some bad decisions. I think not reaching out to people along the way like I could have like said if I get those are friendships or something, but I don't think I don't think. I I don't think I did. I think I did either I chose the wrong people or just like things go badly. And sometimes sure if it's like my fault kind of just like was stationary and kind of stayed and do I love Simon. So yeah, I just, I just feel like I'm like, I'm grateful for the, for the thought and for the family and I am grateful for like, you know, this Posse that's been like a grateful thing. I've been, you know, and the Chance likes you a lot of the walk up and doing in school and being with you.  100%.  That's true. I think, and seems to have done done done a lot for me. And that's why I'm like are all terminating outside at the school. Like  I'm just out of myself and I'm sad that the I couldn't figure out the friend situation and I feel like getting back into it. Just when I was walking home. We can add him and like Adam is just and true. It small. Like, I know I have community and I'm like, extremely lucky for the people I have, but I didn't, I haven't felt that. Like, I want to feel that like, I am like proud and forcing, you know what I mean, and feel loved and seen. And in that way. It's like I didn't get that from any of my attempts to make friends here and not just rough because it's like now it's like, oh, you know, it's almost like  For the sake of Emily.  Not supposed to like I feel like bad about that because it's like okay I come in with Zak Bagans entrance to like gay people to restore my faith in the community. And then it is always come out this. It's like I have the wrong expectations or I don't know. Neither. Do I feel like I'll get coalescent feel like I'm feel deep down. I still have to psych. Like that and uneasy coalescent show. How do you decide to see my friends go and pull through like like micro Connell SMS, you know, is that for like going to destroy like smaller stone that they would like the possible any possibility that cuz it was just fucking time is Pacific. Anything of them self and like that in the fear of losing us.  If I understood that. Yeah. Yeah, but that's just a second.  What is grad school?  Just a little video game. I don't think. I don't think it's like, I don't think it's like, has any Great America, then. Yeah. Sounds like it is like, really like mentally strenuous. Sometimes that's like, really, it's really hard to think about things. But ultimately they bought it at. She comes down to is Nancy thinking so much. I like holding multiple things in your mind, as much as just passing, is that you've seen before, you just like by sitting around the chess board long enough you thought. So just recognized. Do you know if I do this in five moves down. What happened? You know, so it's like, yeah, but it's not like intuitively Robin seeing it. It's not like a, like, a test of intelligence. Like people say, it's just like, if you are exposed to it enough,  Do just that have land patents. And so, yeah, exactly. A hundred percent.  If I'm not like interested in coding so it's like I'm not really interested in chest and the Cascades of like this thing. You can only make a single as things move is all decisions that. Once, you know, just leave the confusion go line by line by line by line by line playing blind. So it's an old here we can. It's about organizing those that was said of Cascades of patents, which is interesting that beautiful.  I know I'm only doing it because it allows me to do things. I don't I don't want to talk about coding. Like I'm not interested in coding. I just want to I want to talk about that allows you to buy a mimicry of it. What time is it?  What the heck? He goes to some fake music. Do you like not gorgeous looking?  It's a Wonderful short car, Ashley  So it's oh, yeah, me and me being sad. And I just have some stuff that I don't think there's nothing was the same.  I just feel like,  Monday, just feel like a kind of afternoon. Just want them around that just go outside. I feel like a  It was really fun when Angie and who got, but like I don't feel like who got Angie and who and he doesn't like to do anymore that relationship just kind of fell apart. Now it like during covid-19 C&G in England and London. On all the directions and then just kind of like last time that I have to go with something, but I have this book for you and ask why, you know, yes, and then she left but yeah, cuz she doesn't really a lot of things.  No. He just kept he got to look like off of that. He instead of like not being friends. He just got that amount of single fact that like, like, why would you do that kind of thing? Like you. You are so messy and blaming you at all. I'm just really messy excetera excetera, but like, it wasn't that but could be like, done something in him. Like once it's like he wants to walk it out, but I think he just, she just us or seeing him is like a patronizing figure.  Colour-pop. Yeah, that's what that's what I'm saying. You know, it's like all everything kind of just fell apart.  100% no chance for like new is Roscoe that in times of everything. So full. You think it's like I think it might be within the range of everything and then like thing is that like those are the people who I'm with to make it was always like more of a community would like, it would have been so different out of making my own like this. Yeah, I put Felipe.  Massive disappointment cuz I was like it was like hope you not even that was just kind of like Josh to. It's like all of my attempts at making friends a and called her and left. No. And they wasn't even like any choices. I made. He looked below us and he was  in the brown house. Looks like friends with his roommate for a second. Zach's. Exactly in wasn't friend. I just had lunch with him. We had dinner with him.  Someone someone to smoke with, you know.  Yeah. Just like what was it my own personal decisions to make friends?  About the problem could imagine what you doing wrong, then you can change it.  All ended up being.  Yeah, I know and I guess Angie is a Man, Too.  100% dollars like stay together and it's like, feels hard to like, but have, I am friends like button like a full move sets. That thing was like, like, all of my class friends are always like God, send me. Always talk to me. Always, what happened. That's fantastic, but it's just like  Somehow it's like I feel like out outside of that. It's like all the pain. You feel outside of the kennel, all the other communes, that pizza, you have your own. Instead of, it's like, you're coming into someone else's Community whenever you hang out with them. Robbing, instead of being with a set of four Jeron.  It's like a lot of the Gods. It seems they do what you like, what you like.  Larry, is there a bunch of those?  Let's let's work. How does that feel? By the way? I love to come out here and we can even like what get for extended periods of time. Anyone he ever.  But like, yeah, I like today for just a little bit emotional. Show. We can even stop by when she gets home. I meant this in the same seagull in my class and I sign is processing. You know, how I told you about that, telling everything that the other Angie and this categorical Katie. Who's that chick? No,  a different one that was  that was another CNC golf who I didn't like the Angie's like extremely selfish and that she was like using me for like  Vaughn said she wasn't interested in making any relationship.  You know, I was always like I can walk in the library. If you want me to know if you like if you need to swing by I'm here and ask me what I've devised and the captain just sending one of my aunts. Is that all of the questions of it?  No, I just cuz I was already helping. Yeah, and then I was like, okay, like maybe this time, you know, it was what I've just been hungry first. Mass time. I called and we told her we talked until I questioned. So you need to have in the while and then we go and I'm like totally just she's not interested in in in like being a friend and her friends in the closet like her friends and then it was like, okay, but like it's like these people are her friends.  Verdi. Your executor. Yeah, and then I'm just, it's just weird. Yeah. I was looking at that too.  I was too late to go to the potato Mountain. It's a little too late. It's going to be here.

I seen that the whole time, the fucking gorgeous cheekbones, the gorgeous, whatever the beautiful nose, and the beautiful eyes, and the statue, on the lips of the everything.  You got you got like all of them.  Son of Indian women.  because I think,  The ones in like I feel like the North Indian, like the beauty sex that truck they so they could be more like a child, whatever. It's like to see like much more generic. Do. You know? I mean, there's like, there's like it's like, oh, it's like a blackhead and yeah, they are beautiful but like I don't like  But if I don't have like that.  I don't know.  Touch color. You go for a dark one. Like I mean cuz your mom.  Gross thing to my girls and apparently dark scares me. See you as juicing.  I don't think so but somehow I quickly like predatory of Eastern culture and Eastern it's like it's really weird and smells like a like a respect and mutual understanding it's like a Spanish Eyes.  Exactly  find what the yellow fever  well I feel like that's like in popular culture at psychsmart  Extremely white in Hawaii.  Extremely resolve. The end like still maintaining that sort of like it's like this still remaining that said if the idea of femininity in the white maintaining sort of like an old older idea of femininity of like Savas of like you know this like,  And this really weird way, you know, it's almost like talking back to sort of something some some like whatever. And it's also just I think if you come to see  Assassins of the flag.  I don't know, in this looks like any of those. And like extreme lightness, you know, like skinny and end in like extremely sort of like twig know if I guess I come home until like it's almost like a more perfect Weston standard, you know with like enough. Like a little bit of like foreign whatever in the world to be like the sacrament. The thing that like, oh I'm doing all of these thing isn't.  I know what it is, is Buffon.  100% iic.  Do you like, you know, if you'd like some kind of idea of globalism as well Robin? This like this logo?  More like my mother. I watched it is because it's like in the full-time, the guy who ends the same thing. I think with my uncle with Thai women. I think I think more than anything goes to the side instead of like they feel that white privilege in this like really palpable and Powerful way like, oh, like I am this like cuz he doesn't mess. He's messing Edition actually my uncle but he's like a mole a note like  But like not like a Benz but so it's up to you. I was here because she was running and cleaning business. She hasn't she had like, you know, like 45, Thai women who is walking fire and they are they clean like hotels and stuff like that, you know, Could Have Lied. But there's still the sense in which like, the Thai women is bad like by because of me, you know, like I am I taking I am sad without me. So if it would be, so if like, you know, there's nothing that the power Dynamic Cyrus likes, still maintains the, in the side of the moon on the place of power in that way, you know what I mean? And then he wants to think that some part of it went in which it's just like, like Kanye set up with the Kim, look alikes it. So I don't know if you've been with someone for very long time, you come to find certain things attractive.  Before and said the whole concept of it looks like she's also like like there's a thing right now.  Yeah, right. I mean if you find a fifth Found, You Found You attractive in a selfie?  I mean like I just as well with regards to set up like the fact that sort of like when I was with you know everyone he should I say again and again and again and again, I just found that has brown feathers and it's like  No, it's just that in Scarsdale at least, you know, the people in trusting with people who farted in the people with different and just so happens that like a great majority of those that are far and no different.  Did happen. When we were broken up, where is coming out, I do think that it's enough to be a trend. If it's like, 34 people just like with me and, you know, it's like it and I guess like it was like, you know, people  7 people.  Okay, Boomer.  The psalter.  I was just problem. Yeah, it's like German descendant.  Weather today.  Who's on the cat?  Joseph, yeah, Joseph friend. Yeah.  Do you guys like look up all the way? But  You guys, when s beso?  How was that? Never asked you about that?  Non-stop me.  Iowa.  Yeah, I know that was a thing that they should have broke the tree. Like I like to Sharon because she was simply liked it so much, but she was she was a great lovely to walk with but it was like, it was crazy to see how like  Yeah, I know. She was like it was like, like they were really struggling but I like, you know, on the house.  Edmonton's. I was, it was, it was very, it was very strange.  Poor kid from Iowa who works when he's not at school like conservative self. Yeah. I know.  That's crazy. But like, Lucas and God, I think.  I tended to sort of like I think the weirdest thing was the just like but like people who are not accepted very much because they tend to be much more accepting and also like infective and only questioning why they are and I think that's what I like. Maybe that's like the thing about like,  That's the same thing with like like that needs to be it. Just so happens. I like most peoples, you know.  Darkness comes from a lack of acceptance, you know, it wasn't that psyche because that far and because done in on them being in you drink so much, so much so many bubbly.  Let's go.  Like that like that. I also questioned like, you know, why was that? Like all of my friends in high school would, you know, and that was the same reason?  Yeah.  I think they're princes is, is which One Max supposed to be in?  Dominant. I was  yeah, I guess.  That's like the thing that likes cat me. Most about the Mac situation. You know what, the rest of you like Max? I like broke my friendship, you know, all at once. He just threw it all the way, you know, because it was it was just  At the same at the same time is not liking. The boys are going to say no because ultimately it just like a sex that's like feels like it's like that sort of like the  That's not manipulative of you.  No, no, you just like I do have the thing, which is, I just forgot in the same voice like that about the situation was going to see you. That was like the only the only like  With my schedule for the walks like to go for a walk.  Yeah, I know. I didn't feel any wants to go out. You know yesterday. I felt bad. What like was was like the stabbing for me was?  I think what has always scared me. Is like the, like, the retribution. I know. It's like the same thing as, like, my dad, you know, it's like,  it supposed to not like,  It's one of those to say that was sort of like fear, then that built in that. Do you know, it's like, yeah, like you can go to like, and it supposed to like, the thing that was was like, was like strange to me that liked is that you tried to make it like, commensurate said, of doing the whole like the whole likes anything?  I was trying it for the first time, you know, and I wasn't even, I wasn't even like trying it, you know, I wouldn't even know it wasn't anything that I never was.  Yeah, but like the thing and then like I have been like dealing with that already, you know, and then cuz there was a whole thing with like, Max and I didn't retribute, I didn't like retaliate or do anything and like part of the whole reason why I ended up like trying to doing that thing with Sam, right? Was because you had done it with Max. And so I wanted to make it sort of like, even you know, is like, oh now you have something that you should test it out. You should test it out, you know, you should try it again and then when I did and then you got like extremely angry at me.  and like and like act and then with this extremely and retaliated in like such a strong way and I was just like like  Like what?  And then you got like extremely angry at me and there was like, you know, her broke up then like because of that situation and then it was like you got angry at me because of that situation and it was like and then you like blind it out. So that you'll feel like a very long time, you know, about like culpability that in like you refuse to take it, you know.  And tongue inside and sensitive like oh, you know, my whatever and then I broke I would have it. And that's what you have been saying at the beginning. You know, that I broke up with him. I broke up with him. I broke up with him, you know, because that's why I see he was like  Yes. Yeah, but like and then like throughout like and will help me. Then was I also like throughout then quarantine then it was like like you were refusing to see the, you know, and got like angry at me every time I try to talk about it and talk about how I wasn't comfortable with that. You got lucky and gave me and then be using it as, like a thing about like, he can know, control of your body and Lance, and that's always there as well. But it was like, I think what I was trying to say is that it wasn't the control of your body. That was that the stab me. It was the fact that like,  Do you know I mean, I mean every single time like we try to talk about it, you just like yeah, I know.  Yeah, cuz I just felt like very much unseen by you for a while and that's why it was like stayed because I didn't feel like I got any resolution from it because I didn't feel like you and you know, and that like lack of resolution is why I kept them hopping on it for like again and again, and again. And again, I felt like I couldn't talk to you.  I never want to do that to you for something so important for so long. And we do I do we have any suicide. I just wanted I just wanted to say that now that we have like we're going to like it when we can actually like talk about it that like in the last emotional times.  yeah, and you know, the pipe doesn't exclude horrible to you and I I was, I offload it so much that heinous on to you and so much like I like was making you crazy and I was  The thing is, is that like to think about the bridge and oppression make sweeping state, is that all intertwined? It's one big. Any person is more or less culpable, me trying to frame it in towards us as I can. And that's more like what you did on Calder. I was like before I was going to toward and I was more like, okay, like her. And I appreciate that.  A really something that if I could take him to give so much. Can't and in that case. I should have done the approach, making it better. I'm like the same time like I appreciate that. It was like such a longing opportunity for both houses false. Like I don't believe in the group sessions history that we should I take back. I agree.  You're today if we didn't see each other, and I think we would have, I think we would have, I think the explosion would happen at some point, you know, and it just might have been on X &, which was last easy to quarantine was like, a space of healing. And, and I really fucking a really fucking appreciate.  The most important thing. That's the most important thing.  I really think like listen to previous two fights with each other, you know, like, I know, but at the same time like that the Romantic in me is like as well. So just saying that like we got there, any way that what we had was just even if we didn't know how to put it towards a really speak about that. Sometimes it really what I thought we have like it was just it was Divinity, you know, it was totaled. It was total like The Walls disappeared and it was like it's one of those think it's one of those like once in a lifetime. You know, it. That doesn't happen. It doesn't even happen to most people. And I mean, it's like, even if it would have been that we would have gotten back to you. I do not believe we would have gone back as quickly as we did, as well as we did. As I do believe that we would have gotten back to have no fucking doubt about that. Probably, cuz we broke up so many times and we always got back together and I think that it  Like this. Just let us know on. This is angels, are these whatever? This is like this. Now, there's no way I'm not letting this happen. You know what I mean? And I believe answer. Do you know what it means? When you say like or we wouldn't have gotten back together. It's like, no, that's like taking out. Like that's like at reducing everything to stock and Sons. When like that's not like it, you know, it's it's it's it's it's the great big story story of the life, you know that it is like the thing that unifies people, you know, this is like the most basic impulse in out of the walls, and it's like I need like  And need to know that. Like, it isn't a second and that's also pulls into the thing about being out, the whole thing about like, me hugging you and then whatever. Like it from stunts cuz that was supposed to hide circumstances. Like totally to find an I was, I was worried that like that, like that. We want last thing that we  I know that you didn't want to see it as So Different At as, you know, like this great baked like, you know, like  Need a raging against everything. You know what I mean? Do you you think so, it's not, it's not just us talking something that this happened in the next time. I think like, will sit with me for it. Is a love story Beyond. So I can do that is bigger than quarantine, that's bigger than that, and it's off of the wall to make it so I can see, you know.  Bringing.  So cute. It is so so cute.  I think I just bet it off. I think the scary thing, you know, because I was like, okay, you're sucking. Sounds can you find us like then? And if the circumstance of quarantine to find us a dino, then it's like any circumstance can break us apart like an hour. Now, then five point is Ben 10 sentences and it's not about quarantine song about that momentum about any of that. Okay? Okay. I was just out with something. I've got about for a while.

This is like, it is love is like the most important thing in the world. It is, you know what, it's for program to be. And do you know?  But it at but I'm not. Like losing that is like, even for those that I have experienced extreme hardship. It's like always build a lava, the love that is lost, that is like that. Even like losing Pirates. Losing what I find like you going to war like family and Community. It's like it and I think buying it back to the original question. Why is it that Bridget in is so captivating two people? I think that the entire point of it is that like a despite like all of them like that to Sia t, love conquers, everything breaks out of pot. That's a whole last thing is that last thing is not like it's it's it's not like I think that we've lost something, there's one thing that is lost and then I've been thinking about for a little bit in like, you know, a culture of like a current culture blank breaking down, those barriers breaking down that Society, long enough to learn these things are going to bring free. Is that the taking away? All the things that previously  Post tension now, everything is like easy. There's no breaking. It's like  Love is been replaced by by sax really?  Love has been replaced by like sex, you know, I'm not like that is like that, you know, the sex positivity thing is like, on one hand is like beautiful, but on the other it's like encouraging also like a divorce of the fact that love used to be the things that I found communities and families and wild sand and everything together. And now it's like, it's like a footnote. It's like a footnote of possible, just possible enjoyment.  They're looking thing on people who I were able to free themselves with the Mamaw's, can still come straight and some like societally has been the easiest and most intuitive thing. I think they are people just find it. Exactly. But like, right now it's sort of like what we fighting against the difference is I feel constrained to that way. We both felt sometimes is like the push that they should have that the ethos in the entire wall, the winter around in which is sort of like, oh, you know what, like sex is the onset, you know, not like love is still a radical thing.

The people I really want the Credit Community with more than just going to disappear it, you know, whether I told Lonnie, you know, I Lauren and Lauren and I had that friend, Charles he was in the Fastpass. We met at TMC. When we hung out a bunch of us must know. She didn't really talk to me. I don't know if she  Oh my God, let me know she or he was back then it was like I like that budding friendship disappeared because of the green military thing.  You know, gone Lauren. So whatever I just wasn't a part of that because I was at CMC, you know, until I can, I fit into the larger group, but I just didn't retain any of those. So it's like that, that Community was listen to buy. Tried to make for myself, just gone, you know, have a whole sexual assault thing, pretty much made it disappear from my life, then disappear, you know, made my life feel feel after, you know, before that relationship really, really happened. Fully until I was like, that was my fresh meat, like all of my attempts to make friends and I will I didn't feel like I stopped and buy a lot of the crowd lien or the whole insides. It's like stop. Like at the feel like it just like all the people who want those normies on a lot of them who. I mean, friends. I just happen to make friends with all the people who go. Because I like the people who don't like,  Can do it. Just been a again and again, and again and again and stop talking to me. And, you know, I made friends. I met friends like the summer. Like, I kind of blew author writes it and went along with on his friends who at that point also said it disappeared from my life because of my mind that I'm talking to you. But you know, back then and then I finally found, you know, the community I did find then which I was really excited about and I want to feel like cement, you know his engine and engine. Jugoso. They lost. I tried to see Angie in London and Brooke like a masterly, just a bungalow, didn't show up pretty much. And then, yeah. I know, it's just like a bit more better about it. She did appreciate the business.  Valley starting at like, really Samantha any anyting. But then, again, I come back, I come back. I come back to the office and drink all the time apart, like, you guys were like in Los Angeles, with friends with people and you guys, like, found you guys a different story, but like I wasn't connected. And then when it came to see me, I was calling Angie about it before. I was like, wait, we're going to build a community, you know, we're going to find all these people. We can find all the cool people in the cool freshman and all the things I'm going to try really even find Bill. I might like it stalled in on the beginning of this past year, you know, and I was like hopeful about them and then everything just sort of a Nike. I meant I meant Felipe who is like I spent several times a week. Hang out with him like trying to build that relationship with and we smoked a bunch and talked to Ponch and it was like a crazy was like he was like this new totally nude really love that.  You know, and then, you know who go left and you left a left, all these, all these people just like disappeared. Yeah. I know what they got for. That thing is, is that like it. I know it's like, I know something because of me that anyone like laughed or anything like that, but like I'm thinking, I'm like, missing a couple names because they're like, I threw up like a list of this. And I was like a relationship. I just feel like I kind of like it. And then after that, I need to spring break trip. It's like I'm not sure like how strong our community is, you know, the lost little Bastian the, you know, that's been there from the beginning, you know, of me, you can call that you know. Like we did with. It's like it doesn't really walk. You know, I'm all together like that, you know, and so the. Will that Community will. So just kind of  100%, but still in town, so, you know, we might be able friends like individually, but in times of community, it doesn't, it doesn't really walk like that, you know, like all together, like it. I feel like all of us have better relationships and not even the at not even slightly, just like doesn't doesn't really mean.  And so. That also felt like, you know, and that was pointless during the trappings of optimism in. This is a different conversation in my check. I didn't feel like it was because it is because I am crazy shit. You know, I'm but I didn't feel like seeing on the stood by you and that was like, you know, in that. Just so, you know, I I that was like an hour or so before the trip to with the stuff that we talked about to its I got it. Was just like it is, if it just it just it just feels like, you know, and then now, you know, with all these people oldest would like, disappeared from my life and now like colleges ending or like at least a lot of those people that lost you people are leaving and I'm questioning sort of like and I have sons in return for that. They all like my friends as well, but they all like in this community that she succeeded in building. You know, I just feel like I kind of like I failed at like like really.  At the things I wanted to change from high school and it might be because of this the fastest wrong decision of coming to see him. See so many pods and possibilities that would. It would have been so much better in which I would have had these people. I wish I could have created a community with them and probably wouldn't leave. And, you know, they wouldn't just said, if I disappear from my life, like, because Andrea and confound, the time of the reason, why she's the reason why she didn't. I'm just like a really fucking weird things, like, whatever because it's, like, I does she not like what I do fucking love her. And she was like, one of my. She's like, it was just I can wrap for the loss of me, felt so jealous that she was hanging out with Simon and just give me know. And then I was like, all the reason why she hangs out with me is because she  It's like weird fucking thing and I'm just like, and it just, it's so fucking sad because like the main friends. I I like just sort of like people I put in I tried and hold like really, to build our relationship with. I don't know if I'm like tape. I'm not really taking them with me into the into the, into the outside wall. So just feels like.  I just I just I just I just failed at that. I just really thought of all these people and I know they're not gone completely, you know, then maybe you know, and we might catch up and there might be some business with me know.  But it's also not like I didn't build that really good relationship. So that one had this sort of like a fantastic. This like things are go by now. It's like I like cuz everyone was like, I almost got that. So many people, you know, like a floor in the I mean got got got for betting on him like pasta is away or something. What time with that? I couldn't I didn't have that. I please get a double-double with a vanilla shake.  Yes, please.  Yeah, sorry. I just I'm the thing is is that like it's not just that but it's so sad that I couldn't build a community outside. Like people all like come together people's friends. Like you know that like, yeah, I know. I just I just wanted to you know, I feel like all these people would have been happy if they had known each other and been friends with each other as much as and I just I just I tried to make it, you know in the beginning of the semester. I was as being a v. I was so you know, I was holding all those coffee things and like really just trying to building trying to build build. I just want that. Like, it's not my fault either. It's just like  And these people are just gone. And, you know, it. That's just really sad. And I feel like now it's like know who to like, just sorta like walking hang out with his friend like that, my friends to spend so much time with them, like, I won't stop, but it's still just a little boy. Feeling the I'm I like they open that. So glad everything feeling a lot for the past week. And now I'm just great. I'm just, I'm just a greasy new people like that, it grief. So I'm just kind of been South negating and just chilling at songs from this place and not really doing too much walkie. That just would have liked to stay.  How are you going to my feelings? All right now?  Right.  You don't like Bound by anything.  Little Bangkok.  So what's been done?  I think, like,  I'm from it.  I can see how continually and it continues thing is it will continue to Southland and you'll continue to learn much much more. It's just like you don't really ever know. Someone is putting on that. Scary the scary part. Is that evening what they want? I think he  Thank you.  I think eventually.  That's like that. That's the ground truth. That makes a relationship possible.  No, that's not what his it's not, what is used to determine whether something is, you know, there is a possibility of, you know, it's it's it's it's like all the consideration of like this person walk is a roommate that is passing. Walk is a financial partner. Do I like all of their friends do? I appreciate that choice and people, you know, like at like a hundred different questions because that this is a thing about. Like, all this relationship with Haley, that like, the biggest thing that worries me is not that relationship. The biggest thing that worries me is the fact that called doesn't really like our friend is about that, is that he'll be spending his whole life to be easy until the decision of whether you want to spend your entire life with those people.  Yeah.  We need, these are, these are the things done.  like it's, it's like a  I am withholding judgment to the best of my ability. I did not appreciate the way that I was really worried by some of the Tendencies she tended to and in which should have liked her. She seems she she she she seemed at a sawfish and vengeful.  this will she like got kind of like I'm  I understand.  Understand isolation times of the question of compatibility and future, like really important like things that are deal breakers in the back to like, not being and have your family with you, you know.  Yeah, I know. I understand that. But like the question is, why that? Cuz that's like that's that's a fight waiting to happen like a big one. It was so like that was just out there just like a lot of I'm not trying to like I'm just saying that they're like a lot of scary things that I like. I didn't know. It was already warned me about whether they think they told me it was like we were sitting in the  Despite the love like some of the things that you seem to like saying and stuff, was it just like, you're just like worried about what that you know, empty as a friend. I will I will be  supporting you very much would like,  Moving in together.  Not. But that like I was worried like going to see Aslan.  You would move to Chicago.  Time, you say it. You say it when you bump it up?  I didn't really what I mean. Like, yeah, sure. Like that gets mad at you. If you said, you said 5th news that fits of sex. And then he said, like.  No income tax in Washington.  Yeah, that makes sense.  Still, I just like.  If you're not, I think all the time is, the will to preserve Asian, showtimes, can go and go and go against so many things of sets. And like, sometimes that's great. That's like talking to me like the impossible. What happened in possibility of it all in the charm of it all, but make sure you're not like being blind to sort of your unhappiness in making these decisions and that as you go forward in the one you asked me that like, I actually like a really can see, I won't even if even if even if you have like let's save your relationship with already sort of like love it. Like stabilizes like pretty good thing when I bought like to just kind of like that then to Aunt happy in Seattle, you know, and she doesn't necessarily move.

There was always I got to go to that. Like, will it will like in my sock bun like deepest States unit won't blow like being like that.  I thought of doing it is unbearable.  I'm a lot like an extremely. Like I also think I wouldn't say all that all. But at the same time, it's like, it's like Eagle goals themselves. Seem to be like more goals about your goals than they seem to be about like that field goals in South exactly.  Mental mentally, understand yourself.  Divine Stone, and give up my days and nights in the push. My icons. Not tonight. I enjoy the Lambs.  You know, just like that to me in the past. They have been some type of pastry classes to sadness and depression and stuff. But those also like other ones that sort of flexible and it is that you actually truly understand, you know, right? It's like when he's associate you like get out of this. Just totals like the channel of everything just senses and then what happened like not not conscious life and just be like, who the fuck are you? You know, and then you feel like it's like it's unbelievably terrifying and comfortable but I don't, I don't think I don't think those moving to the association R Bank document 10, right?  Wenatchee music. This place locking foundations. Totally lacking Foundation.  It's not meaningful. All of this is just a big fuss. It's not meant to be me. I like I do. I seriously don't believe it's going to be meaningful like Training Academy vs. The war. You know, there's something. What's up.  That's what I'm supposed to do.  Right, maybe maybe that's right. You know, old growth isn't good growth, you know, you can just be growing in the wrong direction. You have to go through with this sound. Like, you know, I think that's partly the reason why we get so sad. I mean. So, I made a lot of things, it's just not bringing signaling that you're growing in the wrong direction. So, you know, the song is over that you don't doesn't, doesn't miss no place. It's not. It's not right here. You know, I'm not like, I don't know. There is always think what that will come from like this experience about like, if you, if you're overwhelming feeling it is this all are a lot of these feelings. And if you feel that pulse for like until the end of college and then you get to the end of it, you know, that's going to be like if you listen to the signals, I feel like it would be the it'll be like the perfect chance to sort of like really just like leave out into, you know, it's not like finding finding that sunshine. You know, I think I think that you might be a little bit  Someone else's dreams that we should have just moved into and you don't really know how you moved into them. I have no clue. I'd be doing computer, science stuff and I'm pretty sure it's just my brother's influence with me. You know, I'm wanting really be recognized by him. You know, I think that I think that's the reason I don't feel. I do not feel like I own like my label, the ends of my labor or like a reason for my labor. And that's the most devastating, pause rice and I don't feel like I own like even the reasons why I'm doing things. I don't even have the free will, you know, it feels like it's all just sort of Ben and Ben the part of some programs, whatever. And I cannot wait to get out of that. That's the part. That's the, that's the wheels of the parents and then, and the society and the tracks, but I've been just carved out before the options. It seems like because it's just like, it has been and isn't since we were young. And so I'm not I'm not sure what's going to happen like,  I like all go out and live in the forest for like, 3 months in order to find yourself in order, then to put yourself back in the situation, in the wild, in which you couldn't be us off in the first place. Like that seems absurd to me. If you are a real true. I use a fuel true to yourself off in the forest, don't fucking idea of the ideal. I said, if you are true and you in the fucking Forest, you know, you know like going back yuno and I have a feeling that called would have gotten extremely bored and like restless and like a like to be calling everyone and trying to do whatever. I like off to lick a cut like a two days, you know, I do not think that that is him why he's going to find himself, you know, the owner himself that he will find his realizing that he has to go back to the weather. People are, you know, cuz I can't, I don't, I don't know exactly what what I'm saying, but like it's more that like it. I feel like all of the other things that I like, outside of the range of this, like track of the scope becomes like insta.  Geniusly temporary in our minds. If I go that might be like at this thing portion of the thing while I get this thanks. Of time or like whatever and if it keeps on popping up in like you're stupid, not to listen to it. You know, that's like that's what that's the best way. I feel I do also feel that we see if like if you almost done with this in like going in my following. You know, I'd like to finish it finish. That's just about to write. That's just strength. Enable just like possessed demon in Dhaka condition. I believe in you and I believe in everything, everything everything. That's what if that means you forward and I see that. My question is, is I think feel like you're not listening to you, you know, I don't know how I feel. I feel I feel like there is there is constant process of shutting down messages of the pressing of like a no strangling something down or like whipping something cuz I feel like managing some like crazy be stuffed inside of you.  He is managing the sort of like possum. That's what it's like trying to like, you know, explode out and that's a beautiful and vibrant and full person and I see that they got it all. So that was a side by sides of a night person, either. But not. I just, I just, I just want you to know that you have that beauty and you have that truth. Like a fuel will look like not being, you don't have to question that will because it is, you know, that you have that. You are, you are Simon, you know what I mean? It's that, and it's just like, I'm not sure of like it.  I'm not trying to like some of accepting every ever accepting that cuz I feel like you don't accept yourself.  You constantly shoving things down for yourself. You're not accept this. Like, it's like you, you don't except you didn't accept your sadness. You don't accept your your happiness, you know, you wouldn't accept it. Whatever you would like to take away that, that I just like you, like, you really going to accept yourself. I know if that makes any sense.  mixture of  my subconscious or talk.  Note to self until negotiated.  Love the Best Buy.  Scan the screen.  It's really foundations.  Scuba dive instructors. They found this.  And they are thinking of you and this is taking you down and just tap on the shoulder and makes him realize that he has to come down. We'll actually suffocate and it's this.  I connect with that because there's been situation.  and,  it's exhilarating knowing you have that, you're capable of your that type of mental control and  Really? It doesn't try to hide in toilets.  Exotic Kitty.  No, no, I see it is, extremely truthful. That's what it is. That's the most positive thing there.  How many a bat song is in this back home?

Revengeful not conniving by any means, but just angry. I was a lot of times it's called.  do you have to be leaving and  do you feel like you're still on?  Because I've done that ain't going to happen. I don't use off.  I give, I do believe.  That's okay, but you can't control other people. That's funny.  One person like you as my best friend, Aiden has a lot of unwillingness to like Mets or a planet.  I just I'm just unfathomable just like down the path of uncertainty for whatever reason it could be dragging his heels on things and he didn't get tested before he went to Canada. So it had to come up with a later or stuff like that. And I was just like I told you this would happen if he planned it that he want to do it before.  Ideas, does he put on the table? Cuz he put new ideas on the table? If you just kind of want to just sit around.  He's an extremely funny. He loves going or doing.  and I've also what bugs me is, because  I tried to mend up until just, whatever reason sometimes I do. I've been trying to plan this for weeks now. Yeah, why didn't you input this when I was incapable incapable of his, like style of living pop Sia?  I don't get it.  It's not just cuz you know, it's not because you just know Aiden, right. And like the thing is, when, you know, someone long enough, they become integrated inside of your own, like wild eagle mind yourself in some way. That's how you can stop this. Like. Yeah, I see. That was something like a lot of things. I get angry about myself. I like projecting the songe. All I can get hungry. I can get hungry house because, like, I told Leanne awfully comfortable not performing at all.  Exactly.  I am really close to Angie, but me and Aiden are on it.  And because I care for him time to make his life and when and I do all my anger comes from an idea and maliciously when he's got a response. And so, Ayden is the only person  Yeah, I can see how it's hard to get angry at CERN.  And way too loud.  To get angry at that is, but something about, it is a logical position. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you've had this today.  Yeah.  It wasn't wasn't.  Like, I feel that it's lovely, this life.  Love with also life. I can't sustain.  No, I don't know what my goals are and I don't.  Like, I don't know how much for my pills.  Right. Well, I choose my goal is something. Heartedly have to sacrifice anything there. There's no trade-offs.  Then you got a free. Then you got a pretty good that you don't want to do school. This that's totally fine.  Do I just got into the world? And yeah, I feel like  I don't know. I feel like all this like I'm strapped like  like it when it's getting late last night. So the reason why I like I fucking love songs in this career path. What she's doing is thinking like as like an environmental and like the built environment and stuff as soon as she's walking would like the real, you know, in a way that's like the ends of hot like it. She's totally connected to like, you know, like your, you know, your love and your life is manifested in the life of all these plants, and all of these, and all of these like Landscapes and the people that live there. And, you know,  I like it sits at this, a fucking testimony to it, you know, and that's like the same thing for like, you know, like what Simon to do ultimately is he's just out of microbrewery outfit and ten times faster, than all this, like a nonsense site consulting stuff. If they talkin whatever business business, so it is just like, you know, he's a man. He he ultimately it's just whipping in South Bend in town. The happiness. You know, when he really he really should run. Like, I would like me like a successful sort of like a successful like local sort of like, you know, just checking like the numbers tasting, the bear, you don't like being like I'm being like, super like coldly a rap sheet in this world. So we can talk about like a hundred different things, specifically about this being because he loves that beer, you know, any looks at it like that like that. Like is what he's on. See. Perfect for but he's like whipped himself into something like that and not like 10 times more, like beautiful and successful and 1/2.  Golden like being like, beer, Consultants, whatever and like, end up doing some real estate thing. Like his dad that who's like desperately sad in the big house, you know, where the marriage destroy than, like a total just like lack of Interest or hobbies and anything at all, you know, just like  Seems like a type of terrible choice in my, in my body fat and not like it. There is like this school in like these tracks. They Foster sort of like I said, of our aim into these like totally abstract wall of like business-to-business. So there's like a high-level not connected, just walk. That's like, I don't think it's like, I think it's like  I don't enjoy it because it's like its limits, our ability to even think about the possibilities of like everyone, like out that an existing, you know, and the benefits of anything other than this really narrow, the sense of what I mean to be successful. And you're just like, I don't know how I feel. I feel like I'm sorry. I constantly feel like I'm the constant second-guessing said of why I'm going, you know, because I like what's up? Good at that like consultancy. Any of that stuff. I tried it. You know, I just failed to totally. I just I just got I just couldn't do it because I couldn't like fake like interest in like a passing. This like, a fling with the company, you know, that, that shit's like whatever and I tried like the music stuff, you know, in like, being a music manager and I was like, really fun. And I did that like, like two years, right? And it was, it was, it was fantastic for a bit, but I just felt like I was  Hustling and not like actually, like selling bad music because it was like, I just love the sound, like a song right to hit factories, you know, who just like writing, like the most, like this annoying bullshit, you know, and just like, pumping it into like a random young take tacos who like and who will then saying, and then they'll make a bunch of money from it and excetera excetera. It just felt like a fucking dumb.  So like and now I'm just a tab in animated from those two things, which I like assault. I was whatever. And now I'm kind of like going into Academia, what? Feels wrong because I hate computer science. I hate coding. It's like really interesting what you can do with it. And I love what I can do with it. But I find myself day-in-day-out just fucking, like, typing classes on the screen. That sucks. Absolutely sucks. You know, if it's, it's, it's, it's, it's dumb.  And I feel like totally ridiculous doing it cuz I'm trying to like, I'm like, just right now. I'm just using for one thing and just seeing what we cannot like mustache, like the energy or the day. It's like, it just doesn't.  I just honestly things life is so fucking long and I have no fucking clue, what would be best if it to do. It feels like it's just a man ever along, like it's like a fucking forever. You know, it's life is not short at all. Like, it's I felt like I left like three lifetimes and I feel old and I'm tired. I'm just so tired and I'm not, I'm just, you know, and I'm just like phuc. Yea, okay. Okay. What, what, what's My Age Again now, like what the fuck? You know, that's way too long. You know, I feel like I should, like, I'm like I'll be done in like 15 years it, you know, I know the put me the rest of then because it just it's feel, it feels like fucking forever, you know, and so I just I just honestly think that like, I roll out of bed and I'm just like, what the fuck do I do? Now? I play a game of chess on my phone and then I'm just, like, talk this is boring. But like, all can let me just  Do this cuz honestly, I don't know if I don't I don't feel like there's anything better to do this. Especially it's just like kind of just sucks, you know, video game. I totally lost interest in video games in like ninth grade. They just like an FYI. I told myself I would like addicted to them and kept them during them all the time. Compulsively even though I I hated doing it. I wasn't like I was never like happy like playing video games. I might be like, temporarily like my gratified maintained, you know, but I never felt good and I never laughed playing video games, feeling good and I never would have gotten or just like, okay. This is like while I was supposed to do like, opioids and getting off that and stuff and so is like, let me just cut that shit out because that shit out. Like, isn't she giving me any joy and it's not helping me. It's not, it's not, like, if not, it's not, I don't feel good doing it and it sounds kind of boring. It's so fucking repetitive, you know, and I'm just like walking for the screen walking for this computer.  She doing like Manual Labor Day or just like laboring in like thinking and like trying to whatever and I'm like, fuk. Okay, why? What the fuck? What else is got to do? What, you know, and said, the only reason, like I think the only thing that keeps me going like, just saying, like, why it's fun to do like this just super boring shit, you know, old days. I like, I don't know if there's like so much else that's like, more fun, you know.  And if there is then, like, fuk, I have to finish the shift so that I can do the fun stuff at least, you know, so I can lie down with my book and smoke some weed, you know, and not like I just, I just don't feel like if I smoked weed and read my book fast, I just feel like my God. I'm so behind excetera excetera. Then it becomes like a guilty thing. And I hate that. I hate that pleasure. That's just like on the line with guilt. So what kind of flashes there is like a self-hating pleasure. It's okay. It's just like  Never makes me feel good. And so it's never really pleasure or is it, you know, I don't know when exactly exactly what I'm saying, but it just, it just it just I just on this, I think life is like super fucking long. There is like just by existing. I've done like an unbelievable. I've lived so many lives already, you know, and I met so many people.  Yeah, but the thing is, is that that's only see what it feel about it, like, feels like, right. I just, it's like, I'm just here. And I've been here for a long time. This in mind, has been like tunning almond off, like, he is here now, just everyday just which, which, which which which, which, which, which which so far along.  And so yeah, it just feels like whatever has accumulated over. Like, I just a sea of actions, you know, it is sea of just like, okay. What's  What's like not boring right now? And the best thing I can get from that answer, question is just like, oh, I'm just going to like, sit in like, solve some problems and do some black. And just said, if like, slowly just progressed. I know, feels like,  at least I feel good off to it.  Brian, that's a true pleasure. And I like, never going to give me that. Like, this is my like this is my life. You know, I don't know if it'll have to do that. I think I want that to happen. But like it's always going to be something just I would. So you can put the wooden and it sounds like delicate fast, but like Ethan off like two weeks off and tell Linda to go out and like go do this talk show on like chop this would it's never going to be like, oh my God, it's not, you know, I'm just like  That's not.  True.  Intense.  Feeling.  partially, because  Anyone else, right?  And I think that's the closest way to that's the most feasible because  Take the photos of teachers as a map where I am. I try so hard. I try no matter what I always find myself.  Altering William based on ability a little bit, but I used to be able to just fit in any crowd.  And like be happy with it and laugh. And  Be happy with it stops, like get them to like me. And that was like cool but like me because I wasn't me, but I kind of football.  Anyway, while maintaining the guise of still being vivacy doesn't like that makes sense doesn't make sense and people who I can be myself the most. I think that's just a basic fact of Human Experience like that. So I feel like it that's like I feel like everyone's story.  Yeah.  Call me if I can. Push a, everyone is right. That's the definition of a cliche cliche. True think that going to a cabin would be beautifully painful. Yes. I do.

0,"That makes.  But the, but the forms. I like the entire point of, like, the forms. It's our negation of the component forms are in a gation of, of reality of totally what I say, isn't the entire like concept of the Potomac forms, is that there's a reality more real than the real. The light above it from which everything is manufactured. From what?  No.... The mountain is is, is, is manufactured from some kind of idea Mountain, you know about some wood, but.  In terms of it being so, yeah, but the only thing is that our reality, even our reality isn't.  Truth.. Is.  You know, and he's basically inspired Play-Doh or whatever. But basically his whole thing is, like, what is unit? Like there's a lion that's rendered and gold, you know.  What, what is the lion like the lion is gold? And what is the gold that you have? No access to the forms? Except through their method in the only way we'd like them being like mountains and flowers, but they're the only access to the real that we have. No, but there is no like that. Everlasting in the unfathomable depths of the craggy, istone. Mountain isn't Now isn't that? That is not in perfect at all. It is. It is it is it is it. It is impressive and it is impressive upon you like Beyond any shadow of a doubt, you know,  It's only in fathomable for you. No comprehension. I can totally like that. It was a really interesting question out of the eagle, so that if the Giants about us, like, how would we see things differently, but still to the, to the giant sea, note to the Giants? There is also you know, that the that the Giants would also have that place out. You know, the Giants would also have that place. So cool would be. Who would be this unfathomable? Just like presents into that mean, you know.  Unfathomable * 22.  Deep lake is it just like, you know, there's no chance we can get these ideas of like of imperfection of out of ideas of like, you know, an unfathomable depth. What is that? You know, that does exist for all, you know, no matter what I mean, space is being like the best, you know, like that is true like, you know, and when you, when you saw it, when you started, when you started to look at some of the way in, which like, that the behavior of waves, you know, I'm waveforms how everything even like, atoms and singular things going to bide by Newtonian physics when we measure them are, in fact, just wave wave phones and the opposite position of them. Actually, then I'll let you know.  I had to quit about the shit. I was at Indian food with Kelsey, Adrian, Max. When Max was in town and I don't know. And then like this woman sitting next to us, but she's like a like a Rican university around here. And she was talking with the principal is I wrote it down but basically like your observation of waves Alters their course, yes. Like that. Like it's it's that it's the whole lecture doing it, right? And that that like when you when you actually Wendy would like the cat being dead or alive or existing in the totals on the Southeast states of stupid, the superposition, right? But like  Go to mad because the way your exes, it's not between 0 and 1. Yes, we'll have like proposed all of every sort of like, how to interpret this. Is there a lot of different ways and it's like, people used to position? And will this a like? Oh, that must be alternate realities, right? Because every single possible at its base call, I like both.  Is there a is there anyone that would mean that? Like whichever whichever one that they are in would be a different reality you do at any given time that they have to be concurrent reality because there are those in the clink aren't real humans. The cat, his dad and concurrent reality. And the cat is not there. A little ways to reconcile this.  I don't believe, I don't know exactly what I don't believe in. I don't believe in the in the alternate realities of I have a much stronger belief that like some people think the best solution to all. This is really interesting way. So that like it, what what ends up, what ends up happening is that we can only everything on mass behaves in the Newtonian way because gravity brings enough popsicles together and fixes it mean when you when you observe, when you take any system and you have enough Athens Al things in that system, you know, the joint effects of all of these actions imposing on each other fixes, the states rights. And so that, like, without gravity. What you done have is, is it that would just everything would be everything at once, right? And I will be on the timing, a gravity crates, as it is a centralizing force that then like creates these bodies, you know, any single reality.  in which bodies of any size of the dimension, you know, a certain, whatever fixes things because I'm not like  It's it's like it's in that like things Ripple through the system and the way in which our bodies are things or reality is created. Yes, exactly. The way the way in which like bodies are reality is formed is is through the assemblage of enough of these random particles and that like they say that like, it's like a thing of compression. You know. That like the when when I when I when it stays has solidified into one of the other rights that part of the theory is that like an answer me, one of these things will become liquefied in there. Some like crazy small probability that it does, you know, but if you have enough Athens together, it's like, you know, it just one change ripples through the system and allows for a lot of different things to them becomes terrified into that concrete stays. So this is like the way in which reality. Reality and function.  create precisely, you know, that is that is like  That's what is philosophy, man is kind of, you know.  This ain't the same principle of reality being created by the, by the assemblage of people's beliefs of faults. Like all of us believes being also like, I kind of like random. But if you got enough humans together and a concrete slurry divide, external reality is crazy, you know, in which we live within, this is behavior of any group.  What if you go out sandbox of all Universe? Just a fundamental Force things exist?  Yes, yes, but the thing is for the, for the brothers, but the thing is, we have to figure out what we want to think. We have a question and then when you got to let you know, and then once you get to the Higgs boson boson, then you realize that, you know, this this what reality is just reality is is it's just this like this Cosmic soup, you know, I'll just I'll just like fields and and things just put them into mingling with in each other. You know, I think Steven has like a point and like I kind of in front of like, what is like the most convincing the metaphysical account out there. It's kind of whales, just playing with each other.  It's my fault, you know, it's like a bunch of individual forces and let you know that costing of Wells upon upon these instead of meaningless, right?  Will incentives, read the solar system as well, but Williams for Williams is somehow, is it still is pretty? Is it still hot? Even though still has no Stevens. The reason why I believe at the Y, like gravity itself in that fool as, like, one of the only like natural things to exist, you know, is that, is that it's it, it's not it's it's it's, it's happens because of pure existence as a massive thing of gravity, you know, this does this massive. So the force of gravity, you know, is in Concord,  There's an absolute like you. No, no, no.  So here's a theory to Tryon.  Hello, for me know, thanks, and I know if you land feet first. Don't stare at the unbelievably.  You need to experience that holds your conversation.  I know the canvas. I'm thinking here of two things space and you can't gravity can existing.  Right in.  First Unity, a Sandbox in which gravity can might have an effect in arrange. The sand in somebody to like shift something which is time.  So here's a really cool idea from a book. I just read about. Like I like I think that's like so like what do we know for certain? Right? Then let's go from nationalism. But it's like a piece of cool fucking idea. What do we know for certain? We can't? I mean to exist and we know there was a fundamental forces and from there we can start to build like, okay. What is this? What is this? What is the painting on the canvas? One less thing then I'm going to go to bed.  Snoop Dogg. Nate Dogg.  it's just  It looks funny.  Do you think just like, someone shouted to him? Yeah, he's definitely not spending his time in like, move iMovie.  YouTube cooking like on a cooking show with running joke.  That's a good thing.  I can smell there is there is no way to wrap your head around that. Either way. I'm going to. I've been trying. It doesn't it doesn't, it doesn't like the thing that  It's just like chicken or the egg kind of thing. Cuz I feel like the forces, the force, the forces come task of the forces, create the cameras.  That is just I think human bias that believes that like that is like such a containing. You know, that we think that like things must have some kind of foundation. You know, there is, there is no such thing as like, there's no container for space. There's no container for time, you know, there is no  No, doesn't have to be container.  What's the day? Look like, I'm going to walk all day on poetry. And that's what I need to do. I need to write this book of poetry cuz I'm just about there that I haven't finished. It was about, they like a week and a half ago. Probably two weeks ago on this now, almost two weeks ago, I was about to and I haven't, I haven't liked on this. That's like, I need to, yeah, yeah.  Well.  Yeah, it's going to it's going to be really want to come. Just can't get a hold of my poetry books and grab a table in the library, you know, tomorrow tomorrow. I'm just going to grab my poetry books. Get like a table in the library or something, but pull every put everything out and just start writing and may be sitting like scripts or something, you know, when a table at the end one of those tables and just like read and write and Wilson will distracting.  I am just going to read this book tonight. What is it?  He's great. I've liked started reading him several times and he liked him. I've seen a bunch of bunch of a bunch of interviews with him, and I really like him. Yeah.  Yeah.  Who's that?  Great. Yeah, I know but the same thing would like.  Not tekashi, but he has the right to caution. Murakami is that he wrote a lot of a lot of famous books. I know we didn't Woods that wind-up bird. Chronicle that on the shore.  Extra like really famous. He had a little soda failing gas club that he was walking out and doing stuff at the, you know, any unique poetry. When you get out then there's like, 40, you know, and then just like, yeah, he's also like, I got you a box. Great great. Fucking rise up. Like one of one definitely among my favorites, but they say, the time, I mean, you have to, you have to live a little and want to figure out what to write about mean.  you know, and yeah, he probably like, was like dabbling for a while, but like  Yeah, there's does like like like more and more on like very much convinced that this is a fucking Marathon, you know, this is like like I feel like I've lived far too long already.  Been times about conscious life like very much last, like, I don't know if I was really like alive until like a couple years ago. When I started that she liked be here, you know, I feel like I was like,  It's just I was just I was just roll it was this true experience.  Add kale bedroom. Likes to sleep on the breast of existence, very little like taking in thinking, you know.  I don't know. My my thing is, I'd love to have us an unthinking time like that. You know, I'm ready. I'm ready. I feel like just  Yeah, I just I feel like life is so impenetrable along and just like just just a generation just like an absolute, you know, something that want us to like and or or like move through. I don't know. I don't know how I feel like he has a phrase that I just feel like I've lived so many lives already and I'm, I'm just like, so it's time to start a new one and just like, I am tired. Yeah. We'll see what happens. I guess. I got a little  Metal Access Financial.  Yes, but yeah, I would love to I'm going to try to like that often just like right bunch of poetry at hit me up. Hit me up. First a long time five. I would I would love that and we can open up the bottle, you know.  Yeah, I have some prosciutto and some some cheese.  Goodnight. Take a Simon.  Hey, what's up? It's okay. We just got drunk. And then I got like, kind of like.  Very existential.  Yeah, I don't like it at all.  Did yours is probably Sandra's?  I could have fought for smoking a weed that you don't need either. I'm saying if you're going to get little intoxicated, drunk just makes me.  Angry.  What why what's it for?  Or should I warn Calder? And then to take in the table?  Guys, apparently there's going to be a walk through the apartments tomorrow. So you should probably taken the table by as you'll probably get like Sam with some kind of. Yes, until no. Contraband should be out either. No.  Yeah, yeah, the table they'll probably be like, see you guys.  I want them.  Can I have my contraband?  And take a shower. ",2542,04/01/22,220401_003_me.wav
0,"How you doing?  Okay.  Just chilling. Yeah, I am by the way, I'm sorry to hear that. That Sequoia thing didn't come through.  Write, write the PHD astrophysicist, whatever.  Quantum gravity. Yeah, I'm doing alright.  Been a little sad recently because I've been realizing I know if you had about anything about the Argentina strip.  I was it was just it was just a mess.  Yeah, it was, it was actually like, kind of economically psychologically, spiritually traumatizing. Yeah. I know. It just so, you know, the time it ended up like breaking up with, of course. It was just like a mess and he was like the whole time, anytime you just like ignored every single step of the way, you know, when called was having like difficulty at the airport, when we were just about to leave because like I didn't see nothing except is covet so whatever, you know, and so it was like we was it was a possibility that we talked like it, take a difference lies or something like that. And it was, it was, it was just, it was just, it was just play at it. Like this trap wasn't for us. He didn't really give a shit about us. It was just for him to see Ari and I  Like a Common Thread again and again, and again, and again, he just like, was totally didn't see or recognize any of us. You know, this is something that's been going on for a while, right? You had that conversation between me and Simon not that fast night when you came in. It was like how this, like thing of like trying to sort of like, cold sort of dreams and sort of, like, my Lodge ideas and stuff like that. Like, as being like, silly and you not connected to reality and not like, you know, when you got out since there will understand like, I'm like, fuck you, you know, you haven't seen anything. If I file a brat brat.  It's like who, why? Why do you, why you so set on just why do you not see me? Why don't you try this Penny thing, clear that he's like, never really seen me or anything and I will call the 4th at 9 to put it. Like he's very much like stuck in himself because he had like three tough childhood and no one's really accepted him in like, you know, and because of that he's talking like a little resentful and jealous. I confronted him about tonight and Tina and turns out he's just like mannequin mannequin. Jealous about called that like. Jealousy figures in resentment, lost a lot of other things and it just like really sad because it's like even art like he's desperate now, you know, it to you, like totally cut off, all the things that he was excited, all of, he's only now, I need security, you know, type thing and so like an eagle will do that cuz he just needs to sort of like settle down and have a family in this kind of ejecta fine as well because it's like, okay, anyone who can like, hold of my kid, you know, and just do half.  The REI relaxing and so or at least, you know is using him and he's like fine with that. He didn't really care about that as much as he, you know, as long as he gets.  You know, and so that that's just like really rough because it's like clear that I'm not going to be able to have friendship with him. That was possible at one point.  And you know why you called when I also has physical traumatising? Because when I called her and I went on those that have to go and yeah, we went backpacking stuff, you know, of the tent that we got from the people just didn't want this. If it was broken out of a holes, all over the tents and unlike Patagonia has like an 80 mph winds and extreme weather. And so everything got soaked through food act, like, you know, when we were, you know, and we couldn't like sleep at night because Tenten walking. So we can, you know, and so we have to like hide back after like 2 days, like just starving and I got bitten by some animal into my hand like swelled up to twice its size and it was it was just it was just like I do I didn't even get that time with with called a backpacking. Really. Cuz it was just it was just a mess and it's clear that, you know, we don't really have a friendship us3 anymore.  So we can have like individual relationships. But even those us would have severely, you know, it doesn't really walk. So no more no more for you. That's kind of yeah, it was really rough and I spent so much of my savings and my God coming back. I've been in the kind of sad mood especially because I've realized it like all the people I met friends with old people. I really like to enjoy the TMC old and left every single one of them from the very first moment, you know, like like you and Lauren Frost is GEICO's child's all. All all the people I made relationships with my own relationships with all them left a note. Same thing and sophomore year with several other people that you know, and then now in like seeing you, I was excited cuz I I was like I was going to build this community. I was going to really, you know,  Try to sort of like make things walk between me and seems to be in the people here and bring that Community out with me into the wild and you know, Angie left because of like depression. She's like out who goes like left to pursue opportunities in Lake, Hanna Felipe. This guy who I became like really close to and like we would like we would like to hang out like several times a week and he was like, I was like, oh my God, I hope to meet really cool people here, you know, he his dad died. And then he like as a heroine. He's out of school. And this is just that thing that happens again. And again, and again to like all the people who I become connect close to just happen to these people who really struggle, a CNC machine. She isn't right for that. So all they just end up leaving. And so I just feel like kind of lonely and outside of history or like on the wrong side of History. Somehow by staying here, Will by being here. And so I'm just going to be waiting for it to be over now and then  Kind of lonely.  I'm about, that's about. That's what's really been going through my mind. The past few weeks, in a little bit of a tough time.  Yeah, I'm sorry. I feel like the biggest thing to that is the side the sense of like an ENT, you know, that's really, what kind of bills build it like the building blocks of happiness. You know why that's family or like the friends and the community that we build, you know, if we don't feel like  I can Compass by you. No love in the end, the people that money? No. See, that faces as well. Because like, even if like only abstract, you know, Lord these people and made connections with out in the wild in the still-living, you know, they still alive the still here, but like I might see them like once a year, maybe, you know, I'm not like it then don't like presents an active, you know, day today. And then you have to question you, is that a community or is that me know? And that's really scary because I'm going to win, really sure what we just spend it all kind of life.  I don't, I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question. I did. I see my parents, you know, it's like they all of that Friends episode of like spread out across the walls and they don't really have many friends that kind of just like isolated and they have each other Shore. But  It's Lonely at the Top 10, even.  Starbucks. And then, like,  I feel like I really do. I think it's like,  Take a trying to feel like some void. That just is always there. And so, it's like this has to be this. I also, I think I only, I was opposed to the same way with Centreville. That's why I think, like, I said, I wasn't allowing myself to be happy because I equated, like, happiness would like being sedentary, you know, being like being like, the stable and not moving and, you know, pushing and and growing and then changing, you know, and I liked it. I was thinking of like, you know, relationships is things that you learned from, you know, I was thinking about relationships, these. I see things that we we use in order to grow, like, very deeply and intensely with someone else before. No more. That you can teach them are no more than you can be taught a lot there, a lot. There wasn't a lot of these things that sort of just capsule instead of running around my mind, I think.  I think doing doing acid once or twice. I know it sounds crazy and I'm smoking a little bit of weed on this late may be little more than a little bit. It was like, I was always running around like a hundred and like, like 200% at any given moment. And you know, I I think 11 pot of the possible for me was that I started to sort of like she okay, like how what am I will? Actually makes me happy right. Now, you know what it? What that's the important, what? I like, what you don't you know, and I think I just I come I come down a little bit from where I was before. Not that's enabled me to like I think make most sustained efforts. Like I haven't shifted career paths like it in the past year. That's insane. I was I was a hundred different things that shift Mages and faces and paws and people and I do is just so jump from place to place where I got this like,  The real about past Discovery and now it's like, okay, what things actually cannot like, what things can I see sustained me and that's what I've been asked, what I've been trying to pursue. Now, you know, what's like deep enough? What's what's like full enough that you consider, traveling this path for the rest of your life and never reach the behind, those like that, that's like possibility of, you know, the real, as real possibility. I think that like and that's that's what I've been. That's why I've been chasing in therapy. Also was enormously helpful for me cuz I realized I was just chasing and running and running and running. Because I always felt in her, like I wasn't enough and that I was always feeling that like, I failed at music like I'd failed at my, my original.  Conception this original sort of idea of myself, you know, the fast idea of God, you know, in the garden and that I was thrown out of the garden because I'd failed. I had I had somehow, you know, that's how my dad and I had somehow  You know that I I was now walking down the path. That was just I was never meant to be and that was, that was that was super. I was too fat and anything. He was Superman's. I was away. It was just a seed of discontent in me that I never really knew was planted that, you know, I'm going to grow into like a fool, you know what? I have massive tree of guilt, which I was like, you know, sometime times to sing in front of my rope with dyeing, my cell phone. Just cuz it was you know, how to have to help out a lot it. But I would just like being chased down by a bunch of internal demons and like false ideas of myself. That would just pushing me to like every single moment. I was just a like whipping myself and it was a sort of like do things and I didn't like what I was doing from 9 to 5 at any given moment. I wasn't she happy of happiness with something that was like an end to go, you know, the set has got to sit as God did on Sunday and as if like me know, once I have it to you, once I reach that, you know, I've arrived.  You know, I know until then it's constantly coming until then. It's called some guilt until Bennett's. It's until that moment of arrival of total, you know, spiritual like a Divine just acceptance from the universe, you know, whether it's like this, you know, of a big company idea, like a big, you know, a thing like that really in some something magnificent, like a book, you know, that somehow justifies your entire existence, you know, until then and I didn't feel like I was entitled to be happy, but to be really content and that I have to run until I got that and I, I, I totally disagree with that. Now, I see it as like a pathology actually, some kind of a strange thing that we, that we've been like. I've known by beat the wild that we growing up in. I don't know.  Stable type, right?  Call Lynn.  Right.  It's it's it's it's it's a marathon man. I think that's another thing that I've been thinking about lost. Right? Like, I feel like I've lived life times already and I'm like, 20. No, I'm like it or not, you know, this thing about searching for stavis stability, right? I feel like it, you know, I've been, I already feel like I've been running for quite some time and that, like, there are several lives of Latin and several places. I've been. And I don't like to talk. I'm only 21. Like, this is like, this is a long long long fucking game that was bankrupt. When he was right here. Last year, the 78, he was get a fiance who is dating seven years engaged to. And you know, my mom is well and  You know, that they have we haven't even seen like the, you know, the the beginning, the inklings of failure. We haven't seen any of that really, you know, that real sense of just like cost out of of the walls and of history and yet some of which we already feel so much, not so rough. This like, how the fuck am I meant to keep up the stamina and that's what I, that's what I that's. That's, that's what I think it is. It's all, it's all about. It's all about stamina, right? It's about running running, running the marathon Roslyn, the Sprint. And I feel like we always, we just tiring yourself out with the Sprint again and again, and again. And again, thinking it's going to launch us into like a, a different ashlawn know, like a different to you or a different set of level. When I, I don't think that's true at all. I think it's, I think sustaining the energy and sustaining. Sustaining. You know, that core. Just a cool will, you know, and whatever you have to do to sustain that will that will to survive that will  Grow, that will to change, you know, him that well, that will to be, it will be happy to, you know, that's, that's what it's a me now and I'm trying to figure out. Okay. What what's the longest game? I can play. I'm sorry that you've been feeling this way.  Young entrepreneur of the board that the faceless crazy that Alma nation of the bulshit. That's, it's terrifying. And like my dad, like, wakes up for some often times. Would like these dreams.  Oh, someone stole my I was walking to the Village to get my bike and someone stole my back wheel wheel. So I should have used the chain that they said I should use on my God.  The job, right? Cuz I mean, the bike was, what has it has a lock on it. I just didn't try to walk around Hawks. Okay, that's going to be expensive. Okay, its okay. Its okay. I guess I landed last night.

0,"Spicy. I am just walking up. Guessing you will you should walk down? You want to bring some of that? Is it like a breathable container?  Hello, AJ. The more related to my dad.  But that's when you see used to, like, likes playing my like darker skin tone really like 3, like end up with a good family.  Okay.  Full disclosure. I've had a bit to drink and it went. Well, I thought you about this. You want one.  Okay.  Cross to sew.  I try to be honest.  Yeah, I realized the the fact that just my all of the friends that I like to try to make myself since the beginning of coming to 60 and see all of them left or become implicated in in Crazy. It is in and witness but you know that the puzzle hang out with like to hang out with the outside of called that and Angie called and Simon near the most that was like Lauren Frost hung out with all the fucking time and then this other kid gold Charles.  And then, you know, I hung out a bunch of Nieman and then all the pets of kids who I spend all my time with freshman year to serve split off into groups instead of like disappeared. It just letting you know Lauren left Charles left and even left all the pizza kits. Every single friend. I made either. Laugh will disappear and summer God, brushing you, no answer. I was left with called and then I was like, okay, I'm not wanting to that destroy second. Son's dictate every single thing that goes on in my little like everything else. It just you know, it just being cautious in face-to-face. It's like then like softly and I like try it again and then someone like Max, you know, and he was like one of my one of my life out of this past semester, sophomore year. I just hang out like all the fucking time with Max.  Can I sell something? I saw his side until something profound that right. Now, it's just this, this is a possibility. I can like make my own little, like, little Community. My own little thing. You know, I actually just at proactively, create like, a happy, little family, or friends, you know what I mean? And then, and then everything grew up with sanjana friends to all those relationship coming up, tank for a very long time, you know for what are all of the covid-19 stand for? I came back and then the next thing you know, I lost him and then covid threw up and then all of my friends wants a drink of it together and you know, and then like the other people and then and then serve I came back and I was like, hoping like I'm going to let you know really try to make the most of it. And so so to find my communities. And when those people who I want to try again, you know, and then like the person I spoke to Moose.  Making really deep connection with a man. You know, I'm going to be so full of the time. We talked all the time. We saw each other's. Right thing. We would like real a project music, editing my poetry him. It was just, it was just like a beautiful fucking relationship, you know, and then he took all my poetry books in like in the end of his dad died and the, you know, so I can do some shed is off that day and he just like fucking disappeared as well. As long as like all of my trash out of this is like bounds poetry books. I've hurt you know, it says you just disappeared with all them. Yeah, I know. And so and then Angie dropped out cuz I'd like to put the professional who was gone because of you know, it's going to cost like the Buddha Paz chat and then Argentina sort of like imploded the Lost rooms imploded to the loss of was left with any kind of relationship like a trio Dynamic with Calder and Simon, you know until like the only people left with are you and called her?  All of every single time that I've tried to make friends, everyone's left, and I feel like the outside, hundun avellino. Of course, the whole sexual assault thing, just totally just said, have a relationship as well. And so, it's just like,  Out of all the tents like a constant attempts to sort of tried his about, you put myself out who understood it. Like I just like, how about the handshaking with no one, you know, I'm just like feeling feeling like this because I have so many more difficulty greater difficulties than I do and I just tend to make friends with all the people who shouldn't be at TNC. You know, I'm. They all end up leaving. It sucks because I just feel lonely cuz I just I walk around in them. Just like I am I at Sebring me out of this place, you know what I mean? And I walk around and I feel like if it wasn't those couple people who like again. So, you know, and I'll come place like it just feels like everyone's. Now like you guys are leaving to you know, and then poof that goes the last of it. And I don't even know when like anyone in this is a problem that everyone has it but it's just I feel like I'm sort of like an aberration in time and history and place and I just, I just shouldn't fucking be here. And that's the feeling I felt since I was like a little kid. And so it's just I've never really shake.  Play this like a deep sense of like lack of longing wherever I am and I just don't know what to do with that. You know how to make me really sad.  Cuz I really I don't want to be different like you used to do now. I just want to let you know, have my friends.  I think of you, I think of someone who has like a ton of friends.  I think that sounds lovely.  This is not like it's not that I'm like, I'm like I am so grateful for the people. I have some more of that this like regardless or not, if it's logical or not. It's just us deep sense of grieving cuz it's like all the old people like laughing. I haven't really tough times and just then like Angie said, she couldn't be friends with me. I got. This is when she stopped talking to me. She told it's like she was going to hold me. That's funny. I was everything she wanted to be and so when she just off imploded and did all these things. It's like she couldn't be around me because I just reminded her of like what I said was I don't even know what that means. You didn't say this to me. She said that I was like extremely jealous and cut. Like why are you going through all this stuff? And I can kind of feel like, you know, like you would like you look like you look like you're my best friend.  I've known you for like a bit of a fucking long time and I just I just don't get why you just stop talking to me and then she just come in like, you know up and laughed and I can't like she doesn't respond though. She doesn't. You know, and I'm just like I get really hot because you know, I really love to talk to you so much. I've actually I think several times about how I would like the street from a class my like another class and I was like nothing. Definitely going to be enough for a really actually love you. Thank God for that and then it just kind of like it just I'm just I'm just so agreed.  And that's just what ends up happening a little bit. You know, I just like kind of like kind of wish all these dislike of low nodes, you know, they able to bring like out my dream was to bring them all together and make them more friends than making will feel accepted. You know, I may can just be a little like family, but, you know what, I mean? And like, I really, I really wanted. I just, I just don't know how to do that Community. I mean, I'm not like, you would like individual friends. I don't want to, like, talk with and then like, I know how to like, I don't know how to build a community. I think that it really was instrumental, not because  He just he just never sees me and has never seen me, you know, he drives by Crush my dreams all the time. It's like, you know, stupid shit like hanging out when you were when you get into the real wild. You'll see the excetera excetera excetera you got like, and he's like,  Full just like kind of like, you know, if they don't like me and nothing's really important except like and he like, it totally is like making like Aryan to just like, I'd let you know. I'm because it's like anything, anything that moves that will have his kids tight, you know, and that he's just in this that he just says, it's like really fucked up wyldvue and he like tries to like constantly going to push them in the end of you think that like, you can just be strong and just so, you know, I can be me and I can be around the country about your people and I can just like, still be like my own Fortress and stuff. But you realize that likes to do it. So long next believe, within the aura and then this shift starts like  Trico with way into you and just make you pass a Mystic and angry and resentful, like Simon's had such a tough time growing up. You know, I just hate the fact that made him resentful and confront them about it. And he's like, that's because I'm really jealous of you, right? He said that as well, and he said that, like, I'm jealous too cuz I lost my dreams. They disappeared somewhere along the way and I just need to find security, you know, and he said, yeah. Yeah, you fucking you. Fucking said that as well, and was just by pushing. But, like, from the very start, it's just like this, like how it's resentment, that is just kidding that and it's just ready to pop. I'm just like, God is going to punish. It's just like sucks because  He's never he's like stock within himself and he stuck within his own, like you, no difficulties in Johnny's and whatever. And he's never he, he never, he doesn't see me at all. Sometimes are we saw him is like so extremely straight for like nothing, spoken. Would like motivate his actions. He's like the most emotional person in the world is like this, like damaged, you know, like sort of like,  yeah, I know, and you've known him for a long time, but  Like when you the fucking living with this man for like constantly, it's just it's just it's it's just I feel like poisoned, you know, a little bit because he just like makes me like not want to like, you know, push myself. Like I would like, you know, dream will like, whatever he doesn't like bring out any of the good sides of me and that's because he never got to do that. It's like a combative sort of anger. That's just like that ready to strike at any man, any point. So he is just like it sucks.  No, he didn't even like register for him. It was like, you know, that it was like the biggest shit for office like that. You know, it was just him and his whatever he just picked up and left at the airport when call, the can get his, his beat his like to take any pain again. And again, and again, he did this, you know, and just walking in the door.  And that's like in which type of support instead becomes like proximity and jealousy and said that his like it's actually like a jealousy like that is a psychic sense of black. You know, I like I feel like really fucking sorry, fam. I just hate the fact that like bad so I can stances and his never feeling accept it. Anyway, just let him too and not like it's almost like a resentment that like he called necessarily ignore Lynch himself, but I just feel it coming out in any way anyway, so it's not just that. Yes. It is key to the thing is the Simon and call this thing because that was this idea, that was like it was like out of circumstance, but I was like a little bit of it. Like a manly thing even if it's like, but it's based on like Mutual understanding.  Oh my God, I always felt about someone else putting it on top of it cuz I never felt like that. Yeah. I had like an unusual friendship would like call little bit with sign in but it just felt like something that would just like Kaplan going, because it like we were drifting apart. We want can be friends at the end of sophomore year, you know, and then covid happened.  An example of the friendship or no?  It's so many people it's like it was like cotton you'll like oh, so like I'm nothing like huge, connective and beautiful. And so that's like like mosques and stuff. I just I have this just this feeling of like it, a reputable damage. You know, it's okay. I'm going to see this would have liked happened in time, like whatever the feelings would have been revealed.  And like, I still have a great relationship with Calder and I'm like, I'm really grateful. I'm grateful for that, but it's  I know this feel like everything's kind of like toppling.  And like yeah, I like it that way.  Couple foundations Octonauts, like what? I'm grateful for. It, just it just sucks that you  She's really manipulative. Did I tell you about how it ended? Like she was crazy. She like said like the most horrible things, and not just that but like, I tried to break it off with a twice and she would like the first time, a Grandpa probably died. Like, right? When I was like breaking breaking. Like I said, I didn't believe her in the slightest. There's no way that like that, just happens like,  Right. Like that and not like oh you need to end. She quickly likes. Didn't you didn't call anyone on that any, you know, she just like you have to like what she thought. I got to crying and everything like that and just like you have to take care of me pretty much. She said, I know, just like what? And it was like she was so many fine, you know, and then it just I was just like, I just don't believe it for a second. I don't know if that, you know, because it happened again from the gun, you know, next time I try to break up with her and went. So then she was like, she whatever. But you have to admit she got like a sheet-like fine, but then you have to, at least, you know, do you know you like talk to me? So now you have to like, drink with me at least, you know, and then I was like, oh, you know, she framed in like this really weird. And so, I drank, you know, and then she was like, oh and I was like a constable and she's like all, take your favorite game of chess, you know, and I was like, okay, sure. I didn't like her, she kept them again and again and again, I resync, wagering things.  On the casting like, wagering like, oh, you know, if I win, I get to whatever I, if I would like to put in like sexual act, you know, I know just like, no, I don't want that. You know, I said that a hundred times but then like, why we would like, you know, and it just and then it just said it, like happened. And I just don't know, like, I shouldn't have liked, but it felt like hell so manipulative, and he was totally just fucking, like, it walking with me and ya know. She was, she was like, she was deeply deeply manipulative, and she also said that thing. Yeah. I just, I thought the sign the fact that you misconstrued, all of that and like made it.  Oh, shoot it, shoot it. Shoot. Just Taylor. Cops is on since like like but when she said that she said she said that apparently she had said that like apparently you like pulled her aside or something. You said something and you like? Oh, you should know you should stay away for not type thing. And you shouldn't like to be with him because he's XYZ and stuff. I know we're just like, oh that's like really hot flight in the u.s.a., Something, you know, and that's what that's where that came from. Yeah. She's she's kind of odious.  The tree on your heart. I'm sorry. I was mad at you. I told her aside, Jesus fucking Christ, finished with whatever it was weird to hear up a friend. Say that about you.  Yeah, yeah, I know, right? I told you what, actually, I think I'd like I swept it out of my mind. When you did tell me but I don't remember what you said.  Like volunteer to drive shredding diet back to Clermont instead of using the bus. And then she started saying like, fuck Matt and another cat, and she would fuck Swedish mad. And I was like, oh, what all these things to me about? Like what I said about my like that was not about her that was about my like rape experience type thing. My kind of like all like more just like, you know, we had fucking experience has been to the man to me like  Oh, like I like don't worry about it. Like he's like, sort of been having like a hard time. I was referencing sanjana like, you know, like it's not like any like romantic like flyer anything's. And then you told me that you should stay away from me and that I was a, you know, kind of like trouble and the fat, like, I know, just like it. Bad implications to come. Get some here like, oh, she's crazy. Serial killer Vibe, like American Psycho. That's why I said it was like, it was like has like, you know, Polly shoes. Little bit of a sociopath 5. So, you know, and so she like put up an elaborate set of wall of Defense.  Actually familiar. Have you seen the American Psycho?  Can facial cleanser which that I've been applied with a view of what I look like a human, but I don't feel anything. Same, fucking shit. I do something to tell you taken 20 times. I had for you to eat blackberries and one banana.  Low-fat Greek yogurt. I love that. I drink it and then I post station selfie. I look like a human that I don't feel. Well. That's what she gives me, but she does feel. That's the thing. Is she not like a sociopath psychopath? You just like it has no ability to really like a thighs or like see, you know, see outside of herself so that she's just sitting and she's like, constantly, like in this weird like,  You know, she also feels like she like one like a state championship in chess when she was, like, you know, in like 8 years old or some crazy shit like, I know. And so, she's like, she's like all of that. And she's like, I think use that along with, like, the rest of her life, and all of the sort of, like,  You know, and like she used her body. I think also it's a way to sort of like to sort of like connect with people, which is like, totally fine. Like, people do that. You know, that's great like waiting right now, but like in a different way, you know, and and  Yeah, but I guess the only thing that Thursday at like about how was that? She was, she was, she was like, intense, doesn't end. End up, right? When that's like that, was you, that's when it when a man asks, you that. So I guess that's what we met trick was great, seeing and loved. And I get puts me in the past mindset, in order to see you and love. You know what I mean? I like fills you up with like once results.  Okay, that's good to hear. Why? Why do you like been living in your hip hop? Like, I don't know, any of the few of your friends like that. When did you guys start like being in the same old group that? Yeah. I was like, both on. And yeah, I know we're just we just love each other. I'm like, shocked at how smooth is Ben. Ben are really a kind of beautiful. Do you think it's decent? There is stuff that's like underneath the surface of who had said that like, I mean a lot of them like I don't like Millie and a couple others.  Like that, but they vary at that. Pretty sure why that's why I looked and it feel like that's like so deeply nice but think like put other people before themselves and that's like that might mosque something. And I Monday think that there is anything that I like that, they make some slight since it is actually in like a personal contacts. We're all just like super out to a can with each other is super like candid about a man that's off. I think like they are and I like go to a party with them and they're like something like not talking to anyone and it's like such a character switch with me. But yeah, it into something else when they're like.  Yeah, nothing much more than that, really how it is to just decide something.  I have then I just sort of got pulled back into it. Anyway, please.  We kind of, I kind of just got pulled back into it for a while.  United mean.  I,  Like I did that with Simon asani.  You know, and then.  I'm not like,  Icon just like not told to someone and I would like pulling back into the orbit. You know, I don't know how it's like.  I don't know how, like,  Sometimes, I'm not. So unless they do it to me, in which case I do. I know how to do that depression.  Yeah, I took them like interested. But like the whole thing was that like, you know, she was like going through and like we would always talk instead of like it. I thought that it was like a relationship. I was growing alongside called is in Simon's and stuff like that, you know, and then she like didn't she invite him to go? See a parent's, you know, didn't bite me and you know where that come from. You know, I'm going to grab that came out to like my like strongly dislikes. Me because I was just like called and said it was like oil and vinegar just like toast, you know, but I never felt anything.  Only I don't like it was the one that was like felt rejected and nothing. I don't want to just go back and Lancaster. Are, you know, I'll just sit up like, you know, and then also like today reason why I'm having a bad day. Is that? Like I went to the city yesterday. To see my dad to get sushi. I can really drunk and just like tulips and cover the excess tension, and it was just like, why the fuck am I staying? And my Dad was supposed to just like so awfully and completely awesome place and he liked felt that way unless you know, we should have come to a sad drunk together and now it's just really sad because it's just like, I know  Feeling like I sleeping together, you know like my and then I came back here. I left my bike at the train station and like all of the gas in my bike and I was just like months ago, that shit, you know, I've been like I took it to the to the bike shop hundred and fifty bucks replacement parts in the back to you in two weeks because you know, I'm not like so like I was just lying in the time since I've been close to death. How you like swept insensitive losses in a way, like whatever it's like what what do you think of when you want.  Palpable. Not like end, you know and it just didn't like sweet sin to you. I'm writing this like little metaphysical.  Book of Solomon.  And I was going to do that all day, but I'm like the bike thing ends up taking like 3 hours and then, you know, I figured out that item in time that I haven't like a member. And so, you do tomorrow besides my, I like me to make some chicken for myself, you know, I'll make some rice and some mushrooms and then grab the cost on it. But like I don't know, like I know blisters form. But it's like it's just going to be like a blister tomorrow, but it was worth it. It's only going to get worse.  Because I'm so Frozen.  yes, I just like take this and just fucking photos of fluid just like  Can I use these horrible?  Sipping tea.  Oh my God.  Feels like the universe. Is it like fucking out to like something else?  Yeah, I don't feel like  And because I would like I've given up music. You notice until I put it inside. Yeah, just like it was keeping mental state of failure. You know, that I'd like, always, I know. I've failed, I lost my job. You know what, I like the same, like I can do that was ironic since since Buckley. And what does psycho mean? So I just I needed to get rid of that. Just the stupid like feeling and so I've been feeling and generally have been feeling happy.  Got like a range. Is that like you know, that like it?  Going out. Like I'm, I felt will feel like, I'm becoming more like a logical and stable and whatever and then the older Heights, who is everything is just been clipped. You know, I don't have like, you know, no framing. I'm like the throne ahold of those like, yeah. Just until like I what do I do? If a little chats on my phone?  Read.  see friends, sometimes mostly just those three things, you know, and I just, I just feel like  like I'm doing one, but  I miss.  Pain, I feel now is like a slow soft. Looks like Stone, you know, that just would have way more. It was, you know, if possible losey and I wonder if I could dislike great Catholicism shoot out of you in those beautiful joggle, entry saying, you know, and I just I hate that great. And now it just feels like I'm just sitting and waiting.  Doing well, you know, doing my school walk.  But just like, I mean, first of all, this sounds, this is very familiar to me because I remember, I have like, like you roughly 2, week-long depressive episode has therapy before because even though I feel like I should kill myself or like other stuff like that in like cool poetry or like me having a really tough hearted crumb or just Lake.  Connection with something and stuff. But it's like, that's part of what makes me the person. I feel like a nut and it was on Netflix, but not like heaps of the numbness. I begged that weight. I didn't get anything from there. It was just a parasite.  So like, yeah.  So, I think I am not. I'm not sure.  You wouldn't trade it for any.  I have these like Echoes self-realization like  Coming up against reality.  Paradigm testing.  Love you without funds. My perception of myself when I'm feeling like this.  And then it forced me like that by the time it was when I met you you felt like a whole life.  Van weather up like it with like looking Monday. I am this.  You know, how I feel like, you know, and that was like a fascinating and beautiful to like, you are so good at the, so fucking good at that. So I was just like it was like, you are remarkable that, you are totally blind, but, you know, it to yourself a little bit, you know, it's like, you know, and even the ego was like maybe driving it, you know, but like  You aren't even in touch with the egos last alone like it did, you know?  I don't know cuz I was like, yeah, that's like one of the most of myself and I keep thinking in the shower. I would love to go down to the Village, like outside the town rule, you know.  Ecstasy, makes me feel safe.  He said that he didn't feel safe because I honestly think you're with him and the way I can get her, which was something to me because I feel like I actually take pride in how I make my friend to you.  Really embarrassed.  It's like sort of hard to leak when I go to interact with like all of these guys. I would like. And I like, really can't explain it here in the hole. It made me feel safe and deeply like, oh, yeah.  Commitment.  Is there a vegan? A folino? Yeah, I know. And it's crazy. What the therapist? Oh my God. It's like, it's like  I bet there are a lot of therapist to do it because they got that light.  They got like from not like, you know, like just like  the information. I think these bushes out here.  I have waterproof boots on.  Your way to go to use it.  I left, I woke up into the community building just like look at it. Once I never really, I found on that fiber Studio. Like I hate them all them. Like the Malden sort of like a psyche who's like that knows can use cuz the only Flags I thought Confederate flag of the Isis flag, you know, you know the don't tread on me flag and I just like started like it's thinking of like all of the bad flags and I just couldn't like why is it that. That's a good one. That's a good one.  I just I just don't know how you like flies have been like, like it's like a century of nationalism and just sort of like we did. You know, I just feel like I just like a bad thing. Yeah, they're definitely definitely capitalized. I really didn't know what the process is for. We just heard like a German rock music open. I know they definitely don't like, people don't like having Flags around the far, right?  Yeah, I literally never been up here before. I didn't mean either. It was one of my goals to take a class here. I'm like, so upset that it didn't happen. I wish I could wait. This is really cool with. This is like,  These steps are just fantastic. It's interesting to see what people are making.  Yes, really fucking nice. Why are you? Why are you going to go?  I got that really, really helping the steaks, the gas in the fucking life is like different and I would like to know all of it by myself, like going to be really like complex it. That's why I only see like one night like think about Brazil complex in probably like the one of us must let the fast. What thing is to come to mind is just like a total. Like it's at.  Like India, you know, is that crazy shit going on? Like systematic initiative in the relation and part of that is English being a colonizer language and therefore like not being allowed to be using it on. Yeah, that's one of the reasons why I like I didn't want to walk in ngos off to be in Jordan.  Potli just for all of that because I like him, that, like most most of them were frauds, you know, or just like self-serving, but I also like overwhelmingly. Got this like, weird fucking feeling, you know, that is I haven't been able to shake the ngos are for the people who make the ngos and the people who walk in them. If not for the people to ask and that's like, yes. I know, just in case it is neocolonialism most of the like a lot of these like Charities. Like the fact that like the international charity, whatever and it came out with the missionaries of the charges on the split-off chat groups and shots, like organizations to solve like issues and you know, combat the the Savages bless you. I like Global and international ngos, and when he saw like looking a little bit, you know, it just it just you can't shake the feeling that, you know, is just like the evasive and especially like a lot of  Ultra ones in ones that are trained like change some domestic like all the stuff in the mastic politics and stuff like that. Like, a lot of that. Like a lot of the feminism ngos are just like really wide, you know, going in instead of like, even even if it's like, you know, woman's right to me and trying to like save like like a woman and stuff like that. But it's like this really, really weird contact, you know, it's like with you. Yes, regardless of what, what do you think? Like in your own life moral Universe? Like, what you believe is right or wrong? And, you know, it's just, it's it's, it's total like, you know, I'm sensitive, like, cultural conversion, and, and turn on the south now and bodies is not just out of making them waxed and body, you know what I mean? And crazy. Not like Weston like female body that then instead of like, it's like the same like body politic, you know.  Got like, has been going on throughout history. It just like for it would like a nice him off, and, you know, they just end up radicalizing. Did you do that kind of bunch of authors friends, who are really lovely? Like, I have dreams about it all the time. So one person who was walking who does a translator for the Fort, like you and stuff, and then for whatever, like I got put in contact with her and she just happened to be 26 year-old. Super cool walking like a wonderful outfit, but she's like got married now and also kind of disappeared.  But yeah, I know but she's it was like wonderful cuz, you know, she had a whole community. And she was so accepting welcoming and you know, in like people on the sea other countries and they are you know Hospitality like yeah, so she was she was she was absolutely wonderful going but it was a long time. So it's like you're alone for a week and I went to the same like, you know, to stores. Just so they were familiar cuz I don't have anything as me. I was tough but I know I did. I did it. That's remarkably adoptive son. I don't think I was long enough together to sort of like that truth. The thriving been like. It's rough. But like, you'll find people that, you know, I have no doubts about that. You shouldn't be, you shouldn't be afraid. You shouldn't be afraid of that. What's more?  But is that like the fast like month or two with more Staffing in like exciting? Even if he'll talk? Sometimes it's going to be like, you know, and then it's like when you stopped trying to settle in for the Rhythm Knotts, when you start getting depressed, right? It's something happens with the end of being that, you know, it's just like the sense of like, isolation the sense of like, it's like, no, I don't need you anymore. It's just a friend and like, weird and unsettling, but like so many different parts of a subconscious. And that's when people say, like I was moving to new places like a month or two of them. Like, what happen when you go up a little bit and then it just you going to depression for like 6 months, you know, I like that, you know, some dude with some conscious depression because your body just can't deal with that, you know, and then it stopped going up. They sell parking right, but that's like a expected, right? It's meant to be difficult.  Ability. Just like working Brazil. After graduate fact, I can be friends is like a half weeks back. Half Iranian like, Jewish boy from Los Angeles with like it was like born in the Iran-Contra. I think about that all the time with sounds like we are the product looks like we are the product of so many bad things and there's no way in history. You know, I would ever be to you, you know, what happened, right? We'll just be sort of like, throwing out of History. Kindness.  You know, what communities are we can build? What ideas are we going to make? I feel like it's going to be it's going to be exciting. I really need to do a boy or a 50. Yeah. Crude and our expectation of the I I think I like the oil in the lawyer who was like organizing all the things you don't like house arrest for next week.  I don't think he has his own problems and whatever and he's kind of like it. Like when you look at him interacting with, he's kind of like hanging like self-serving as well as some feta. You happen to them again, just like the rest of the day everyday, you know, but at the end of the day, right, I mean if you want them shooting for the political violence, then you got to take what comes of that, you know, that the raid was fun. And I also heard from fault, if you guys went again, the next day, really, that's crazy.  I appreciate that. I just this was my mindset, by the way, like when the raid was happening and see if you could imagine that. It's like my feelings of like me. No sadness, and liked what I saw was just like, going to a rave. And then like saw engine affect came down with a stomach bug. So I was like, it was like kind of like she's at. She's an angel.

I'm talking about with us. We'd even though, like, she seemed more of that false, even though she seemed more that false like she's really satisfying, her relationship with them and they're only see a wonderful little community and family, you know, and she's doing well in the car. So she like wants to drop out every, you know, other week, but it's more of like a cathartic even though. Yeah, like she's got like the will to execute on any of it, you know, of these like, you know, I hate plans. I don't know if they would be great 5 right now because she is happy, you know, elsewhere.

Fixation to see if that begun. Yeah, I don't know how she's going to use that. What channel will do we? And I'm not sure what's going to happen. But if not, it's not me this time cuz, you know, I think it was like picking on you. When you're in a relationship is like often times.

It is not like a land acknowledgement can be like a like a piece of hot then you know, like I know there's much more thing is that can like it create the spirits and make you understand.  Exactly.
