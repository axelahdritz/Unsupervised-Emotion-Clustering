I'm going to talk about the idiot by Ali Fateh men, which I checked out from the Claremont College library, but regrettably, they don't have the jacket on it. So but it is and it follows her. As she navigates, her freshman versity and it's actually semi-autobiographical Road. It partially actually during her own first year at Harvard and a scholar of Russian literature. And so she's inspired by kind of long winding stories in which nothing really happens and her book kind of takes cover on it, discusses the passing of time and let me know how to get new space it and our own identities versus those around them. So I first read this book and junior year. I had found even earlier in my college career because I think",0.973885178565979,0 days 00:00:00.500000,0 days 00:00:59.600000,11/15/21,211115_001_me.wav
1,"Good job, speaking to build reflecting on her own experience and it shows first-year students that it's okay to different than the other students around you. And we all have our own experience things in different ways. And I think especially the Claremont colleges that something that we really benefit from hearing from ya.

And in reality, I think reading is not the same reading. Any book is not the same.

So, it's just a wonderful. It can be a bit slow at times but I think that it also very much speaks to life and at the possible as well. I would recognize the students who early, like I said before, it really speaks to kind of that first year and candid way. It's funny. It's awkward.

I think one of them, it's the type of Novel where once you put it down on feel like you're immersed in the character's perspective.
