# Unsupervised Emotion Clustering using Multimodal Features on a Personal Language Corpus

### Abstract

Recent years have seen a spike in research on human affect recognition and emotion detection (ED) in the machine learning community. However, little research has been done to personalize these approaches for individuals looking to explore their own language and emotions. In this paper I perform unsupervised emotion clustering on a personal language corpus using the K-Means algorithm and demonstrate its efficacy using only VAD lexical features and a few emotionally rich acoustic features.
